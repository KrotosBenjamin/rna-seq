  abstract  = {The mRNA isolated from B lymphocyte tumor cell lines directs synthesis of two forms of ? heavy chain, one with a molecular weight of 67K and one of 64K. When these cell lines are converted to IgM-secreting cells by fusion with a myeloma cell, the 64K form of ? predominates; thus it is designated ?s (?-secreted). The 67K form correlates with the presence of surface IgM; thus it is designated ?m (?-membrane). Cells that make both forms of ? chain have two mRNAs, one of 2.4 kb that encodes ?s and one of 2.7 kb that encodes ?m. The difference between the ?s and ?m mRNAs can be localized to their 3? ends by hybridizing 32P-cDNA copies of the mRNA to a cloned copy of ?s mRNA, treating the mixtures with SI nuclease, and resolving the nuclease-resistant duplexes by electrophoresis. By probing the separated species of RNA with a DNA copy of the 3? untranslated region of ?s mRNA, it was shown that the 3? ends of the two ? mRNAs do not cross-hybridize. The difference between the two RNAs was mapped to the 3? edge of the C?4 domain. Apparently two separate 3? terminal sequences for ? mRNA are encoded in the genome, one that specifies an amino acid sequence appropriate for membrane-binding and a second that is involved in secretion. At different stages of immunocyte development, different ? mRNAs predominate: ?m during the lymphocyte stages and ?s during the secretion stages.

The efficacy of this adaptive response ultimately relies on the ability to express a particular protein at the right time and in the right place. Although mRNA localization is a mechanism shared by most organisms, it is especially relevant in highly polarized cells, such as differentiated neurons. 3?-Untranslated regions (3?UTRs) of mRNAs are critical both for the targeting of transcripts to specific subcellular compartments and for translational control. Here we review recent studies that indicate how, in response to extracellular cues, nuclear and cytoplasmic remodeling of the 3?UTR contributes to mRNA localization and local protein synthesis.

  abstract  = {Point mutations frequently cause genetic diseases by disrupting the correct pattern of pre-mRNA splicing. The effect of a point mutation within a coding sequence is traditionally attributed to the deduced change in the corresponding amino acid. However, some point mutations can have much more severe effects on the structure of the encoded protein, for example when they inactivate an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), thereby resulting in exon skipping. ESEs also appear to be especially important in exons that normally undergo alternative splicing. Different classes of ESE consensus motifs have beena described, but they are not always easily identified. ESEfinder (http://exon.cshl.edu/ESE/) is a web-based resource that facilitates rapid analysis of exon sequences to identify putative ESEs responsive to the human SR proteins SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40 and SRp55, and to predict whether exonic mutations disrupt such elements.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (bfCNs) which provide innervation to the hippocampus and cortex, are required for memory and learning, and are primarily affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), resulting in related cognitive decline. Therefore generation of a source of bfCNs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is crucial for in vitro disease modeling and development of novel \{AD\} therapies. In addition, for the advancement of regenerative approaches there is a requirement for an accurate developmental model to study the neurogenesis and survival of this population. Here we demonstrate the efficient production of bfCNs, using a novel embryoid body (EB) based non-adherent differentiation (NAdD) protocol. We establish a specific basal forebrain neural stem cell (NSC) phenotype via expression of the basal forebrain transcription factors NKX2.1 and LHX8, as well as the general forebrain marker FOXG1. We present evidence that this lineage is achieved via recapitulation of embryonic events, with induction of intrinsic hedgehog signaling, through the use of a 3D non-adherent differentiation system. This is the first example of hPSC-derived basal forebrain-like NSCs, which are scalable via self-renewal in prolonged culture. Furthermore upon terminal differentiation these basal forebrain-like \{NSCs\} generate high numbers of cholinergic neurons expressing the specific markers ChAT, \{VACht\} and ISL1. These hPSC-derived bfCNs possess characteristics that are crucial in a model to study \{AD\} related cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain. Examples are expression of the therapeutic target p75NTR, the release of acetylcholine, and demonstration of a mature, and functional electrophysiological profile. In conclusion, this work provides a renewable source of human functional bfCNs applicable for studying \{AD\} specifically in the cholinergic system, and also provides a model of the key embryonic events in human bfCN development. },

  abstract = { MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that extensively regulate gene expression in animals, plants, and protozoa. miRNAs function posttranscriptionally by usually base-pairing to the mRNA 3′-untranslated regions to repress protein synthesis by mechanisms that are not fully understood. In this review, we describe principles of miRNA-mRNA interactions and proteins that interact with miRNAs and function in miRNA-mediated repression. We discuss the multiple, often contradictory, mechanisms that miRNAs have been reported to use, which cause translational repression and mRNA decay. We also address the issue of cellular localization of miRNA-mediated events and a role for RNA-binding proteins in activation or relief of miRNA repression. },

Nucleic acids other than DNA-RNA hybrids are not affected to a comparable degree. The enzyme rapidly degrades polyribouridylic acid if it is hybridized to polydeoxyriboadenylic acid, but not if it is hybridized to polyriboadenylic acid. Experiments with double labelled DNA-RNA hybrids show that specifically the RNA moiety of the hybrid and not the DNA is attacked by the enzyme.},

Here, we have directly compared the neural-differentiation capacity of human iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We have shown that human iPSCs use the same transcriptional network to generate neuroepithelia and functionally appropriate neuronal types over the same developmental time course as hESCs in response to the same set of morphogens; however, they do it with significantly reduced efficiency and increased variability. These results were consistent across iPSC lines and independent of the set of reprogramming transgenes used to derive iPSCs as well as the presence or absence of reprogramming transgenes in iPSCs. These findings, which show a need for improving differentiation potency of iPSCs, suggest the possibility of employing human iPSCs in pathological studies, therapeutic screening, and autologous cell transplantation.},

A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided athttp://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000 different users.},

For cases with a deletion mutation, the “reading frame” hypothesis predicts that BMD patients produce a semifunctional, internally deleted dystrophin protein, whereas DMD patients produce a severely truncated protein that would be unstable. To test the validity of this theory, we analyzed 258 independent deletions at the DMD/BMD locus. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutation is in agreement with the “reading frame” theory in 92\% of cases and is of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The distribution and frequency of deletions spanning the entire locus suggests that many “in-frame” deletions of the dystrophin gene are not detected because the individuals bearing them are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features.

The ability to manipulate alternative splicing using antisense oligonucleotides, as demonstrated in several studies during the past year, makes it an important and attractive approach to altering gene expression. A review of these studies leads to the conclusion that antisense oligonucleotides, whether designed to affect the cytoplasmic mRNA or nuclear pre-mRNA, function predominantly in the nucleus and not the cytoplasm.},

These deletions abrogate the reading frame and the lack of dystrophin results in progressive muscle deterioration. \{DMD\} patients experience progressive loss of ambulation, followed by a need for assisted ventilation, and eventual death in mid-twenties. By the method of exon skipping in dystrophin pre-mRNA the reading frame is restored and the internally deleted but functional dystrophin is produced. Two oligonucleotide drugs that induce desired exon skipping are currently in advanced clinical trials. },

  abstract = {Expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is under tight regulation to accommodate its intricate roles in controlling brain function. Transcription of BDNF initiates from multiple promoters in response to distinct stimulation cues. However, regardless which promoter is used, all BDNF transcripts are processed at two alternative polyadenylation sites, generating two pools of mRNAs that carry either a long or a short 3′UTR, both encoding the same BDNF protein. Whether and how the two distinct 3′UTRs may differentially regulate BDNF translation in response to neuronal activity changes is an intriguing and challenging question. We report here that the long BDNF 3′UTR is a bona fide cis-acting translation suppressor at rest whereas the short 3′UTR mediates active translation to maintain basal levels of BDNF protein production. Upon neuronal activation, the long BDNF 3′UTR, but not the short 3′UTR, imparts rapid and robust activation of translation from a reporter. Importantly, the endogenous long 3′UTR BDNF mRNA specifically undergoes markedly enhanced polyribosome association in the hippocampus in response to pilocarpine induced-seizure before transcriptional up-regulation of BDNF. Furthermore, BDNF protein level is quickly increased in the hippocampus upon seizure-induced neuronal activation, accompanied by a robust activation of the tropomyosin-related receptor tyrosine kinase B. These observations reveal a mechanism for activity-dependent control of BDNF translation and tropomyosin-related receptor tyrosine kinase B signaling in brain neurons.},

  abstract  = {Deletions giving rise to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the less severe Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) occur in the same large gene on the short arm of the human X chromosome. We present a molecular mechanism to explain the clinical difference in serity between \{DMD\} and \{BMD\} patients who bear partial deletions of the same gene locus. The model is based on the breakpoints of intragenic deletions and their effect on the translation of triplet codons into amino acids of the protein product. Deletions identified in three \{DMD\} patients are shown to shift the translational open reading frame (ORF) of triplet codons for amino acids, and each deletion is predicted to result in a truncated, abnormal protein product. Deletions identified in three \{BMD\} patients are shown to maintain the translational \{ORF\} for amino acids and predict a shorter, lower molecular weight protein. The smaller protein product is presumed to be semifunctional and to result in a milder clinical phenotype. The same \{ORF\} mechanism is also applicable to potential 5′ and 3′ intron splice mutations and their effect on protein production and clinical phenotype. },

We found a conserved increase in expression of mRNAs terminating at upstream polyadenylation sites after activation of primary murine CD4+ T lymphocytes. This program, resulting in shorter 3'UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3'UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3'UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs.},

We previously derived position weight matrices to predict putative ESEs specific for four human SR proteins. The score matrices are part of ESEfinder, an online resource to identify ESEs in query sequences. We have now carried out a refined functional SELEX screen for motifs that can act as ESEs in response to the human SR protein SF2/ASF. The test BRCA1 exon under selection was internal, rather than the 3′-terminal IGHM exon used in our earlier studies. A naturally occurring heptameric ESE in BRCA1 exon 18 was replaced with two libraries of random sequences, one seven nucleotides in length, the other 14. Following three rounds of selection for in vitro splicing via internal exon inclusion, new consensus motifs and score matrices were derived. Many winner sequences were demonstrated to be functional ESEs in S100-extract-complementation assays with recombinant SF2/ASF. Motif-score threshold values were derived from both experimental and statistical analyses. Motif scores were shown to correlate with levels of exon inclusion, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm and extend our earlier data, as many of the same motifs are recognized as ESEs by both the original and our new score matrix, despite the different context used for selection. Finally, we have derived an increased specificity score matrix that incorporates information from both of our SF2/ASF-specific matrices and that accurately predicts the exon-skipping phenotypes of deleterious point mutations.},

  abstract = {mRNA polyadenylation and pre-mRNA splicing are two essential steps for the maturation of most human mRNAs. Studies have shown that some genes generate mRNA variants involving both alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Polyadenylation in introns can lead to conversion of an internal exon to a 3′ terminal exon, which is termed composite terminal exon, or usage of a 3′ terminal exon that is otherwise skipped, which is termed skipped terminal exon. Using cDNA/EST and genome sequences, we identified polyadenylation sites in introns for all currently known human genes. We found that ∼20\% human genes have at least one intronic polyadenylation event that can potentially lead to mRNA variants, most of which encode different protein products. The conservation of human intronic poly(A) sites in mouse and rat genomes is lower than that of poly(A) sites in 3′-most exons. Quantitative analysis of a number of mRNA variants generated by intronic poly(A) sites suggests that the intronic polyadenylation activity can vary under different cellular conditions for most genes. Furthermore, we found that weak 5′ splice site and large intron size are the determining factors controlling the usage of composite terminal exon poly(A) sites, whereas skipped terminal exon poly(A) sites tend to be associated with strong polyadenylation signals. Thus, our data indicate that dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing leads to widespread polyadenylation in introns and contributes to the complexity of transcriptome in the cell.},

Here we show that the rat BDNF gene consists of four short 5? exons and one 3? exon encoding the mature BDNF protein. Eight different BDNF mRNAs with four different 5? ends and two alternative polyadenylation sites are transcribed from this gene. BDNF mRNAs containing exons I, II, and III are expressed predominantly in the brain, whereas exon IV transcripts predominate in the lung and heart. mRNAs containing exons I, II, and III increase markedly in the brain after kainic acid-induced seizures, whereas exon IV mRNA increases only slightly. Several transcription initiation sites were mapped upstream of the four 5? exons, and transfection of promoter-reporter gene constructs confirmed that these sequences act as promoters. Combined, the data demonstrate that alternative usage of four promoters within the BDNF gene and differential splicing control tissue-specific and seizure-induced expression of BDNF mRNA.

BDNF mRNAs containing exons I, II, and III are expressed predominantly in the brain, whereas exon IV transcripts predominate in the lung and heart. mRNAs containing exons I, II, and III increase markedly in the brain after kainic acid-induced seizures, whereas exon IV mRNA increases only slightly. Several transcription initiation sites were mapped upstream of the four 5? exons, and transfection of promoter-reporter gene constructs confirmed that these sequences act as promoters. Combined, the data demonstrate that alternative usage of four promoters within the BDNF gene and differential splicing control tissue-specific and seizure-induced expression of BDNF mRNA.},

We show that four factors (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28) are sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells. These induced pluripotent human stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. Such induced pluripotent human cell lines should be useful in the production of new disease models and in drug development, as well as for applications in transplantation medicine, once technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral integration) are eliminated.},
