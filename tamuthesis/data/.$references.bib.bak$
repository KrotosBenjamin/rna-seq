  abstract =  {The mRNA isolated from B lymphocyte tumor cell lines directs synthesis of two forms of ? heavy chain, one with a molecular weight of 67K and one of 64K. When these cell lines are converted to IgM-secreting cells by fusion with a myeloma cell, the 64K form of ? predominates; thus it is designated ?s (?-secreted). The 67K form correlates with the presence of surface IgM; thus it is designated ?m (?-membrane). Cells that make both forms of ? chain have two mRNAs, one of 2.4 kb that encodes ?s and one of 2.7 kb that encodes ?m. The difference between the ?s and ?m mRNAs can be localized to their 3? ends by hybridizing 32P-cDNA copies of the mRNA to a cloned copy of ?s mRNA, treating the mixtures with SI nuclease, and resolving the nuclease-resistant duplexes by electrophoresis. By probing the separated species of RNA with a DNA copy of the 3? untranslated region of ?s mRNA, it was shown that the 3? ends of the two ? mRNAs do not cross-hybridize. The difference between the two RNAs was mapped to the 3? edge of the C?4 domain. Apparently two separate 3? terminal sequences for ? mRNA are encoded in the genome, one that specifies an amino acid sequence appropriate for membrane-binding and a second that is involved in secretion. At different stages of immunocyte development, different ? mRNAs predominate: ?m during the lymphocyte stages and ?s during the secretion stages.

The efficacy of this adaptive response ultimately relies on the ability to express a particular protein at the right time and in the right place. Although mRNA localization is a mechanism shared by most organisms, it is especially relevant in highly polarized cells, such as differentiated neurons. 3?-Untranslated regions (3?UTRs) of mRNAs are critical both for the targeting of transcripts to specific subcellular compartments and for translational control. Here we review recent studies that indicate how, in response to extracellular cues, nuclear and cytoplasmic remodeling of the 3?UTR contributes to mRNA localization and local protein synthesis.

  abstract =     {The multilineage differentiation capacity of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells offers a potential testing platform for gene products that mediate mammalian lineage determination and cellular specialization. Identification of such differentiation regulators is crucial to harnessing ES cells for pharmaceutical discovery and cell therapy. Here we describe the use of episomal expression technology for functional evaluation of cDNA clones during ES-cell differentiation in vitro. Several candidate cDNAs identified by subtractive cloning and expression profiling were introduced into ES cells in episomal expression constructs. Subsequent differentiation revealed that the Wnt antagonist Sfrp2 stimulates production of neural progenitors. The significance of this observation was substantiated by forced expression of Wnt-1 and treatment with lithium chloride, both of which inhibit neural differentiation. These findings reveal the importance of Wnt signaling in regulating ES-cell lineage diversification. More generally, this study establishes a path for rapid and direct validation of candidate genes in ES cells.},

  abstract = {Prolonged propagation of human embryonic stem (hES) cells is currently achieved by coculture with primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) serving as feeder cells. Unlike mouse ES cells, adding growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor is insufficient to maintain undifferentiated hES cells without feeder cells. The presence of uncharacterized rodent cells or crude extracts imposes a risk to the clinical applications of hES cells. While others looked for a replacement of MEFs with human fetal cells, we attempted to use easily accessible postnatal human cells such as human marrow stromal cells (hMSCs). Culture-expanded hMSCs from multiple donors were used as feeder cells to support growth of the H1 hES cell line under a serum-free culture condition. Human ES cell colonies cultured on irradiated hMSCs amplified >100-fold during the 30-day continuous culture (in five passages). The longest continuous expansion of hES cells on hMSCs tested to date is 13 passages. The expanded hES cells displayed the unique morphology and molecular markers characteristic of undifferentiated hES cells as observed when they were cultured on MEFs. They expressed the transcription factor Oct-4, a membrane alkaline phosphatase, and the stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4, but not the SSEA-1 marker. Expanded hES cells on hMSCs retained unique differentiation potentials in culture and a normal diploid karyotype. The well-studied hMSCs (and this animal cell- and serum-free system) may provide a clinically and ethically feasible method to expand hES cells for novel cell therapies. In addition, this system may help to identify cytokines and adhesion molecules that are required for the self-renewal of hES cells.},

Upon extended culture, hiPSCs adopt a gene expression profile more similar to hESCs; however, they still retain a gene expression signature unique from hESCs that extends to miRNA expression.

  abstract =  {Abstract Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (bfCNs) which provide innervation to the hippocampus and cortex, are required for memory and learning, and are primarily affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), resulting in related cognitive decline. Therefore generation of a source of bfCNs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is crucial for in vitro disease modeling and development of novel \{AD\} therapies. In addition, for the advancement of regenerative approaches there is a requirement for an accurate developmental model to study the neurogenesis and survival of this population. Here we demonstrate the efficient production of bfCNs, using a novel embryoid body (EB) based non-adherent differentiation (NAdD) protocol. We establish a specific basal forebrain neural stem cell (NSC) phenotype via expression of the basal forebrain transcription factors NKX2.1 and LHX8, as well as the general forebrain marker FOXG1. We present evidence that this lineage is achieved via recapitulation of embryonic events, with induction of intrinsic hedgehog signaling, through the use of a 3D non-adherent differentiation system. This is the first example of hPSC-derived basal forebrain-like NSCs, which are scalable via self-renewal in prolonged culture. Furthermore upon terminal differentiation these basal forebrain-like \{NSCs\} generate high numbers of cholinergic neurons expressing the specific markers ChAT, \{VACht\} and ISL1. These hPSC-derived bfCNs possess characteristics that are crucial in a model to study \{AD\} related cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain. Examples are expression of the therapeutic target p75NTR, the release of acetylcholine, and demonstration of a mature, and functional electrophysiological profile. In conclusion, this work provides a renewable source of human functional bfCNs applicable for studying \{AD\} specifically in the cholinergic system, and also provides a model of the key embryonic events in human bfCN development. },

  abstract =     {Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase found in all eukaryotes. The enzyme is a key regulator of numerous signalling pathways, including cellular responses to Wnt, receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors and is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, ranging from glycogen metabolism to cell cycle regulation and proliferation. GSK-3 is unusual in that it is normally active in cells and is primarily regulated through inhibition of its activity. Another peculiarity compared with other protein kinases is its preference for primed substrates, that is, substrates previously phosphorylated by another kinase. Several recent advances have improved our understanding of GSK-3 regulation in multiple pathways. These include the solution of the crystal structure of GSK-3, which has provided insight into GSK-3's penchant for primed substrates and the regulation of GSK-3 by serine phosphorylation, and findings related to the involvement of GSK-3 in the Wnt/beta-catenin and Hedgehog pathways. Finally, since increased GSK-3 activity may be linked to pathology in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, several new GSK-3 inhibitors, such as the aloisines, the paullones and the maleimides, have been developed. Although they are just starting to be characterized in cell culture experiments, these new inhibitors hold promise as therapeutic agents.},

  abstract =     {In mammalian cells, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) exists as two homologs, GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta, encoded by independent genes, which share similar kinase domains but differ substantially in their termini. Here, we describe the generation of an allelic series of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines with 0-4 functional GSK-3 alleles and examine GSK-3-isoform function in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. No compensatory upregulation in GSK-3 protein levels or activity was detected in cells lacking either GSK-3alpha or GSK-3beta, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was normal. Only in cells lacking three or all four of the alleles was a gene-dosage effect on beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription observed. Indeed, GSK-3alpha/beta double-knockout ESCs displayed hyperactivated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and were severely compromised in their ability to differentiate, but could be rescued to normality by re-expression of functional GSK-3. The rheostatic regulation of GSK-3 highlights the importance of considering the contributions of both homologs when studying GSK-3 functions in mammalian systems.},

In this review, we describe principles of miRNA-mRNA interactions and proteins that interact with miRNAs and function in miRNA-mediated repression. We discuss the multiple, often contradictory, mechanisms that miRNAs have been reported to use, which cause translational repression and mRNA decay. We also address the issue of cellular localization of miRNA-mediated events and a role for RNA-binding proteins in activation or relief of miRNA repression. },

The pluripotency of these embryonic stem cells was demonstrated conclusively by the observation that subclonal cultures, derived from isolated single cells, can differentiate into a wide variety of cell types. Such embryonic stem cells were isolated from inner cell masses of late blastocysts cultured in medium conditioned by an established teratocarcinoma stem cell line. This suggests that such conditioned medium might contain a growth factor that stimulates the proliferation or inhibits the differentiation of normal pluripotent embryonic cells, or both. This method of obtaining embryonic stem cells makes feasible the isolation of pluripotent cells lines from various types of noninbred embryo, including those carrying mutant genes. The availability of such cell lines should made possible new approaches to the study of early mammalian development.},

  abstract =     {Embryonic stem (ES) cells rely on growth factors provided by feeder cells or exogenously to maintain their pluripotency. In order to identify such factors, we have established sub-lines of STO feeder cells which exhibit variable ability in supporting ES cell self-renewal. Functional screening identifies WNT5A and WNT6 as STO cell-produced factors that potently inhibit ES cell differentiation in a serum-dependent manner. Furthermore, direct activation of beta-catenin without disturbing the upstream components of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway fully recapitulates the effect of WNTs on ES cells. Importantly, the WNT/beta-catenin pathway up-regulates the mRNA for Stat3, a known regulator of ES cell self-renewal in the mouse. Finally, LIF is able to mimic the serum effect to act synergistically with WNT proteins to inhibit ES cell differentiation. Therefore, our study reveals part of the molecular mechanisms by which the WNT/beta-catenin pathway acts to prevent ES cell differentiation through convergence on the LIF/JAK-STAT pathway at the level of STAT3.},

Nucleic acids other than DNA-RNA hybrids are not affected to a comparable degree. The enzyme rapidly degrades polyribouridylic acid if it is hybridized to polydeoxyriboadenylic acid, but not if it is hybridized to polyriboadenylic acid. Experiments with double labelled DNA-RNA hybrids show that specifically the RNA moiety of the hybrid and not the DNA is attacked by the enzyme.},

Muscle tissue isolated from both DMD-affected boys and mdx mice contained no detectable DMD protein, suggesting that these genetic disorders are homologous. Since mdx mice present no obvious clinical abnormalities, the identification of the mdx mouse as an animal model for DMD has important implications with regard to the etiology of the lethal DMD phenotype.

Here, we have directly compared the neural-differentiation capacity of human iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We have shown that human iPSCs use the same transcriptional network to generate neuroepithelia and functionally appropriate neuronal types over the same developmental time course as hESCs in response to the same set of morphogens; however, they do it with significantly reduced efficiency and increased variability. These results were consistent across iPSC lines and independent of the set of reprogramming transgenes used to derive iPSCs as well as the presence or absence of reprogramming transgenes in iPSCs. These findings, which show a need for improving differentiation potency of iPSCs, suggest the possibility of employing human iPSCs in pathological studies, therapeutic screening, and autologous cell transplantation.},

  abstract =     {As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display becomes critical. A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided athttp://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000 different users.},

  abstract = {Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) inhibit cholinergic synaptic transmission by specifically cleaving proteins that are crucial for neurotransmitter exocytosis. Due to the lethality of these toxins, there are elevated concerns regarding their possible use as bioterrorism agents. Moreover, their widespread use for cosmetic purposes, and as medical treatments, has increased the potential risk of accidental overdosing and environmental exposure. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel modalities to counter BoNT intoxication. Mammalian motoneurons are the main target of BoNTs, however, due to the difficulty and poor efficiency of the procedures required to isolate the cells, they are not suitable for high-throughput drug screening assays. Here, we explored the suitability of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived motoneurons as a renewable, reproducible, and physiologically relevant system for BoNT studies. We found that the sensitivity of ES-derived motoneurons to BoNT/A intoxication is comparable to that of primary mouse spinal motoneurons. Additionally, we demonstrated that several BoNT/A inhibitors protected SNAP-25, the BoNT/A substrate, in the ES-derived motoneuron system. Furthermore, this system is compatible with immunofluorescence-based high-throughput studies. These data suggest that ES-derived motoneurons provide a highly sensitive system that is amenable to large-scale screenings to rapidly identify and evaluate the biological efficacies of novel therapeutics.},

For cases with a deletion mutation, the “reading frame” hypothesis predicts that BMD patients produce a semifunctional, internally deleted dystrophin protein, whereas DMD patients produce a severely truncated protein that would be unstable. To test the validity of this theory, we analyzed 258 independent deletions at the DMD/BMD locus. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutation is in agreement with the “reading frame” theory in 92\% of cases and is of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The distribution and frequency of deletions spanning the entire locus suggests that many “in-frame” deletions of the dystrophin gene are not detected because the individuals bearing them are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features.

A subset of imprinted genes acquires a tissue-specific imprinted status during the course of tissue development, and this process can be analyzed by means of an in vitro differentiation system utilizing embryonic stem (ES) cells. In neurons, the gene Ube3a is expressed from the maternal allele only, and a paternally expressed non-coding, antisense RNA has been implicated in the imprinting process in mice and humans. Here, to study the genomic imprinting mechanism, we established F1 hybrid ES cells derived from two sub-species of Mus musculus and established an in vitro neuronal differentiation system in which neuron-specific imprinting of Ube3a was recapitulated. With this system, we revealed that the switch from biallelic expression to maternal, monoallelic expression of Ube3a occurs late in neuronal development, during the neurite outgrowth period, and that the expression of endogenous antisense transcript from the Ube3a locus is up-regulated several hundred-fold during the same period. Our results suggest that evaluation of the quality of ES cells by studying their differentiation in vitro should include evaluation of epigenetic aspects, such as a comparison with the genomic imprinting status found in tissues in vivo, in addition to the evaluation of differentiation gene markers and morphology. Our F1 hybrid ES cells and in vitro differentiation system will allow researchers to investigate complex end-points such as neuron-specific genomic imprinting, and our F1 hybrid ES cells are a useful resource for other tissue-specific genomic imprinting and epigenetic analyses.},

The ability to manipulate alternative splicing using antisense oligonucleotides, as demonstrated in several studies during the past year, makes it an important and attractive approach to altering gene expression. A review of these studies leads to the conclusion that antisense oligonucleotides, whether designed to affect the cytoplasmic mRNA or nuclear pre-mRNA, function predominantly in the nucleus and not the cytoplasm.}

  abstract = {Expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is under tight regulation to accommodate its intricate roles in controlling brain function. Transcription of BDNF initiates from multiple promoters in response to distinct stimulation cues. However, regardless which promoter is used, all BDNF transcripts are processed at two alternative polyadenylation sites, generating two pools of mRNAs that carry either a long or a short 3′UTR, both encoding the same BDNF protein. Whether and how the two distinct 3′UTRs may differentially regulate BDNF translation in response to neuronal activity changes is an intriguing and challenging question. We report here that the long BDNF 3′UTR is a bona fide cis-acting translation suppressor at rest whereas the short 3′UTR mediates active translation to maintain basal levels of BDNF protein production. Upon neuronal activation, the long BDNF 3′UTR, but not the short 3′UTR, imparts rapid and robust activation of translation from a reporter. Importantly, the endogenous long 3′UTR BDNF mRNA specifically undergoes markedly enhanced polyribosome association in the hippocampus in response to pilocarpine induced-seizure before transcriptional up-regulation of BDNF. Furthermore, BDNF protein level is quickly increased in the hippocampus upon seizure-induced neuronal activation, accompanied by a robust activation of the tropomyosin-related receptor tyrosine kinase B. These observations reveal a mechanism for activity-dependent control of BDNF translation and tropomyosin-related receptor tyrosine kinase B signaling in brain neurons.},

We then explain the various types of stem cells utilized in neurodegenerative disease research, and outline important issues to consider in the transition of stem cell therapy from bench to bedside. Finally, we detail the current progress regarding the applications of stem cell therapies to specific neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. With a greater understanding of the capacity of stem cell technologies, there is growing public hope that stem cell therapies will continue to progress into realistic and efficacious treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here we review recent progress in this so-called canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We discuss Wnt ligands, agonists, and antagonists, and their interactions with Wnt receptors. We also dissect critical events that regulate beta-catenin stability, from Wnt receptors to the cytoplasmic beta-catenin destruction complex, and nuclear machinery that mediates beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Finally, we highlight some key aspects of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in human diseases including congenital malformations, cancer, and osteoporosis, and discuss potential therapeutic implications.},

We present a molecular mechanism to explain the clinical difference in serity between \{DMD\} and \{BMD\} patients who bear partial deletions of the same gene locus. The model is based on the breakpoints of intragenic deletions and their effect on the translation of triplet codons into amino acids of the protein product. Deletions identified in three \{DMD\} patients are shown to shift the translational open reading frame (ORF) of triplet codons for amino acids, and each deletion is predicted to result in a truncated, abnormal protein product. Deletions identified in three \{BMD\} patients are shown to maintain the translational \{ORF\} for amino acids and predict a shorter, lower molecular weight protein. The smaller protein product is presumed to be semifunctional and to result in a milder clinical phenotype. The same \{ORF\} mechanism is also applicable to potential 5′ and 3′ intron splice mutations and their effect on protein production and clinical phenotype. },

Recently, a second factor, Wnt, with similar activity was found. However, the relationship between these completely different signals mediating the overlapping functions is still unclear. Here, we report that the conditioned medium of L cells expressing Wnt3a maintains ES cells in the undifferentiated state in feeder-free culture, followed by expression of stem cell markers and their ability to generate germline chimaeras. However, although the activity of this conditioned medium is dependent on Wnt3a, recombinant Wnt3a protein cannot maintain ES cells in the undifferentiated state. As supplementation with Wnt3a to the sub-threshold level of LIF alone was not sufficient to maintain ES self-renewal, the results of maintenance of the undifferentiated state indicated the synergistic action of Wnt and LIF. Induction of constitutively activated beta-catenin alone is unable to maintain ES self-renewal but shows a synergistic effect with LIF. These observations indicate that the Wnt signal mediated by the canonical pathway is not sufficient but enhances the effect of LIF to maintain self-renewal of mouse ES cells.},

However, though STO cells have some advantages over PMEFs and human embryonic fibroblasts (hEFs) as feeder cells, they have never been used as feeder cells to establish hES cell lines. In this study, three hES cell lines (Miz-hES1, Miz-hES2, and Miz-hES3) were established from inner cell masses (ICM), using STO as feeder cells. The three hES cell lines had normal karyotypes and expressed high levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP), cell surface markers (SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81), and transcription factor Oct-4. After culture on STO cells for 2 yr, hES cells maintained the potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers. Our results show that STO feeder cells have the potential to support the establishment and maintenance of hES cell lines.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, human embryonic stem (hES) cells have become very important resources for basic research on cell replacement therapy and other medical applications. The purpose of this study was to test whether pluripotent hES cell lines could be successfully derived from frozen-thawed embryos that were destined to be discarded after 5 years in a routine human IVF-embryo transfer programme and whether an STO cell feeder layer can be used for the culture of hES cells. METHODS: Donated frozen embryos (blastocysts or pronuclear) were thawed, and recovered or in vitro developed blastocysts were immunosurgically treated. All inner cell masses were cultured continuously on an STO cell feeder layer and then presumed hES cell colonies were characterized. RESULTS: Seven and two cell lines were established from frozen-thawed blastocysts (7/20, 35.0%) and pronuclear stage embryos (2/20, 10.0%), respectively. The doubling time of hES cells on the immortal STO cell feeder layer was approximately 36 h, similar to that of cells grown using fresh mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder conditions. Subcultured hES cell colonies showed strong positive immunostaining for alkaline phosphatase, stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4) and tumour rejection antigen 1-60 (TRA1-60) cell surface markers. Also, the hES colonies retained normal karyotypes and Oct-4 expression in prolonged subculture. When in vitro differentiation of hES cells was induced by retinoic acid, three embryonic germ layer cells were identified by RT-PCR or indirect immunocytochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that establishment of hES cells from frozen-thawed blastocysts minimizes the ethical problem associated with the use of human embryos in research and that the STO cell feeder layer can be used for the culture of hES cells.},

We found a conserved increase in expression of mRNAs terminating at upstream polyadenylation sites after activation of primary murine CD4+ T lymphocytes. This program, resulting in shorter 3'UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3'UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3'UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs.},

  abstract =     {Human and mouse embryonic stem cells (HESCs and MESCs, respectively) self-renew indefinitely while maintaining the ability to generate all three germ-layer derivatives. Despite the importance of ESCs in developmental biology and their potential impact on tissue replacement therapy, the molecular mechanism underlying ESC self-renewal is poorly understood. Here we show that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is sufficient to maintain self-renewal of both HESCs and MESCs. Although Stat-3 signaling is involved in MESC self-renewal, stimulation of this pathway does not support self-renewal of HESCs. Instead we find that Wnt pathway activation by 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), a specific pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), maintains the undifferentiated phenotype in both types of ESCs and sustains expression of the pluripotent state-specific transcription factors Oct-3/4, Rex-1 and Nanog. Wnt signaling is endogenously activated in undifferentiated MESCs and is downregulated upon differentiation. In addition, BIO-mediated Wnt activation is functionally reversible, as withdrawal of the compound leads to normal multidifferentiation programs in both HESCs and MESCs. These results suggest that the use of GSK-3-specific inhibitors such as BIO may have practical applications in regenerative medicine.},

They provide both a cellular vector for the generation of transgenic animals and a useful system for the identification of polypeptide factors controlling differentiation processes in early development. In particular, medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells contains a polypeptide factor, ES cell differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA), which specifically suppresses the spontaneous differentiation of ES cells in vitro, thereby permitting their growth as homogeneous stem cell populations in the absence of heterologous feeder cells. ES cell pluripotentiality, including the ability to give rise to functional gametes, is preserved after prolonged culture in Buffalo rat liver media as a source of DIA. Here, we report that purified DIA is related in structure and function to the recently identified hematopoietic regulatory factors human interleukin for DA cells and leukaemia inhibitory factor. DIA and human interleukin DA/leukaemia inhibitory factor have thus been identified as related multifunctional regulatory factors with distinct biological activities in both early embryonic and hematopoietic stem cell systems.},

Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts.

Many are morphologically similar to embryos of the 6- to 8-day egg-cylinder stage. From 8 to 10 days of culture about half of the embryoid bodies expand into large cystic structures containing alphafoetoprotein and transferrin, thus being analagous to the visceral yolk sac of the postimplantation embryo. Approximately one third of the cystic embryoid bodies develop myocardium and when cultured in the presence of human cord serum, 30% develop blood islands, thereby exhibiting a high level of organized development at a very high frequency. Furthermore, most embryonic stem cell lines observed exhibit similar characteristics. The in vitro developmental potential of embryonic stem cell lines and the consistency with which the cells express this potential are presented as aspects which open up new approaches to the investigation of embryogenesis.},

  abstract = {mRNA polyadenylation and pre-mRNA splicing are two essential steps for the maturation of most human mRNAs. Studies have shown that some genes generate mRNA variants involving both alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Polyadenylation in introns can lead to conversion of an internal exon to a 3′ terminal exon, which is termed composite terminal exon, or usage of a 3′ terminal exon that is otherwise skipped, which is termed skipped terminal exon. Using cDNA/EST and genome sequences, we identified polyadenylation sites in introns for all currently known human genes. We found that ∼20% human genes have at least one intronic polyadenylation event that can potentially lead to mRNA variants, most of which encode different protein products. The conservation of human intronic poly(A) sites in mouse and rat genomes is lower than that of poly(A) sites in 3′-most exons. Quantitative analysis of a number of mRNA variants generated by intronic poly(A) sites suggests that the intronic polyadenylation activity can vary under different cellular conditions for most genes. Furthermore, we found that weak 5′ splice site and large intron size are the determining factors controlling the usage of composite terminal exon poly(A) sites, whereas skipped terminal exon poly(A) sites tend to be associated with strong polyadenylation signals. Thus, our data indicate that dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing leads to widespread polyadenylation in introns and contributes to the complexity of transcriptome in the cell.},

We recently noted several similarities between partially purified DIA and a haemopoietic regulator, myeloid leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a molecule which induces differentiation in M1 myeloid leukaemic cells and which we have recently purified, cloned and characterized.

This effect has variously been attributed to stimulation of Wnt signalling by beta-catenin, stabilization of Myc protein and global de-inhibition of anabolic processes. Here we demonstrate that beta-catenin is not necessary for embryonic stem cell identity or expansion, but its absence eliminates the self-renewal response to Gsk3 inhibition. Responsiveness is fully restored by truncated beta-catenin lacking the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain. However, requirement for Gsk3 inhibition is dictated by expression of T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) and mediated by direct interaction with beta-catenin. Tcf3 localizes to many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells. Our findings confirm that Tcf3 acts as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that beta-catenin directly abrogates Tcf3 function. We conclude that Gsk3 inhibition stabilizes the embryonic stem cell state primarily by reducing repressive influence on the core pluripotency network.},

  abstract =  {Direct differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into functional motor neurons represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, to screen new drug compounds, and to develop new therapies for motor neuron diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Many current protocols use a combination of retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog (Shh) to differentiate mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells into motor neurons(1-4). However, the differentiation efficiency of mES cells into motor neurons has only met with moderate success. We have developed a two-step differentiation protocol(5) that significantly improves the differentiation efficiency compared with currently established protocols. The first step is to enhance the neuralization process by adding Noggin and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Noggin is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and is implicated in neural induction according to the default model of neurogenesis and results in the formation of anterior neural patterning(6). FGF signaling acts synergistically with Noggin in inducing neural tissue formation by promoting a posterior neural identity(7-9). In this step, mES cells were primed with Noggin, bFGF, and FGF-8 for two days to promote differentiation towards neural lineages. The second step is to induce motor neuron specification. Noggin/FGFs exposed mES cells were incubated with RA and a Shh agonist, Smoothened agonist (SAG), for another 5 days to facilitate motor neuron generation. To monitor the differentiation of mESs into motor neurons, we used an ES cell line derived from a transgenic mouse expressing eGFP under the control of the motor neuron specific promoter Hb9(1). Using this robust protocol, we achieved 51±0.8% of differentiation efficiency (n = 3; p < 0.01, Student's t-test)(5). Results from immunofluorescent staining showed that GFP+ cells express the motor neuron specific markers, Islet-1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Our two-step differentiation protocol provides an efficient way to differentiate mES cells into spinal motor neurons.},

It has been suggested that there is an insufficient number of stromal precursor cells in HUCB to form a hematopoietic-supporting feeder layer in primary cultures. The present study shows that HUCB does contain a significant accessory cell population that routinely develops into a confluent, adherent cell layer under defined primary culture conditions. HUCB-derived adherent layers were shown to support long-term hematopoietic activity for an average of 4 months. This was achieved by using a customized coverslip with a modified surface structure as the cell attachment substratum and using a specialized culture feeding regime. We have characterized the various cell types (including fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells) and extracellular matrix proteins (including fibronectin, collagen III, and laminin) that were present in abundance in the HUCB-derived adherent cell layer. In contrast, oil red O-staining fat cells were rarely detected. ELISA and bioassays showed that stem cell factor and interleukin 6 were produced by the HUCB stromal cell cultures, but interleukin 3 or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor was not detected. Application of this hematopoietic culture system to transgenic and gene therapy studies of stem cells is discussed.},

We show that four factors (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28) are sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells. These induced pluripotent human stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. Such induced pluripotent human cell lines should be useful in the production of new disease models and in drug development, as well as for applications in transplantation medicine, once technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral integration) are eliminated.},

               The ability to identify active compounds ("hits") from large chemical libraries accurately and rapidly has been the ultimate goal in developing high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the "suitability" of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called "Z- factor," is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.

  abstract = {Numerous disease-associated point mutations exert their effects by disrupting the activity of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). We previously derived position weight matrices to predict putative ESEs specific for four human SR proteins. The score matrices are part of ESEfinder, an online resource to identify ESEs in query sequences. We have now carried out a refined functional SELEX screen for motifs that can act as ESEs in response to the human SR protein SF2/ASF. The test BRCA1 exon under selection was internal, rather than the 3′-terminal IGHM exon used in our earlier studies. A naturally occurring heptameric ESE in BRCA1 exon 18 was replaced with two libraries of random sequences, one seven nucleotides in length, the other 14. Following three rounds of selection for in vitro splicing via internal exon inclusion, new consensus motifs and score matrices were derived. Many winner sequences were demonstrated to be functional ESEs in S100-extract-complementation assays with recombinant SF2/ASF. Motif-score threshold values were derived from both experimental and statistical analyses. Motif scores were shown to correlate with levels of exon inclusion, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm and extend our earlier data, as many of the same motifs are recognized as ESEs by both the original and our new score matrix, despite the different context used for selection. Finally, we have derived an increased specificity score matrix that incorporates information from both of our SF2/ASF-specific matrices and that accurately predicts the exon-skipping phenotypes of deleterious point mutations.},

  abstract = {Point mutations frequently cause genetic diseases by disrupting the correct pattern of pre-mRNA splicing. The effect of a point mutation within a coding sequence is traditionally attributed to the deduced change in the corresponding amino acid. However, some point mutations can have much more severe effects on the structure of the encoded protein, for example when they inactivate an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), thereby resulting in exon skipping. ESEs also appear to be especially important in exons that normally undergo alternative splicing. Different classes of ESE consensus motifs have been described, but they are not always easily identified. ESEfinder (http://exon.cshl.edu/ESE/) is a web-based resource that facilitates rapid analysis of exon sequences to identify putative ESEs responsive to the human SR proteins SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40 and SRp55, and to predict whether exonic mutations disrupt such elements.},
