  abstract  = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an essential class of molecular species that have been difficult to monitor on high throughput platforms due to frequent lack of polyadenylation. Using a polyadenylation-neutral amplification protocol and next-generation sequencing, we explore ncRNA expression in eleven human tissues. ncRNAs 7SL, U2, 7SK, and HBII-52 are expressed at levels far exceeding mRNAs. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with rRNA methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively: spleen expresses both, hypothalamus expresses mainly C/D box snoRNAs, and testes show enriched expression of both H/ACA box snoRNAs and RNA telomerase TERC. Within the snoRNA 14q cluster, 14q(I-6) is expressed at much higher levels than other cluster members. More reads align to mitochondrial than nuclear tRNAs. Many lincRNAs are actively transcribed, particularly those overlapping known ncRNAs. Within the Prader-Willi syndrome loci, the snoRNA HBII-85 (group I) cluster is highly expressed in hypothalamus, greater than in other tissues and greater than group II or III. Additionally, within the disease locus we find novel transcription across a 400,000 nt span in ovaries. This genome-wide polyA-neutral expression compendium demonstrates the richness of ncRNA expression, their high expression patterns, their function-specific expression patterns, and is publicly available.},

  abstract  = {Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly /`housekeeping/', whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of U small nuclear RNAs (U-snRNAs) involved in various RNA processing reactions in the nucleoplasm and nucleous. Most of the U-snRNAs have 5'-terminal caps added to the end of the primary transcript. Here we describe two variants of a snRNA, called U17, identified in human HeLa cells. U17 RNA may be involved in ribosome biogenesis since it is found in the nucleolus and sediments with 40S structures possibly representing nascent ribosomal subunits. U17 RNAs contain no cap but have a monophosphate at the 5'-terminus indicating that they are processed from longer precursors. The U17 RNAs are encoded within introns 1 and 2 of the single copy gene RCC1 which codes for an important cell cycle regulatory protein. In HeLa cell S-100 extract, U17 RNA is faithfully excised from a longer RNA transcript derived from the intron yielding 5'-monophosphorylated RNA. These data suggest that U17 RNAs are not independently transcribed but are processed out of the RCC1 pre-mRNA or out of the spliced introns. IMAGES:},

Sequencing of these RACE products mapped the positions of uncapped ends either exactly to or just downstream of archived CAGE tags.

  abstract = {The complexity of the eukaryotic transcriptome is generated by the interplay of transcription initiation, termination, alternative splicing, and other forms of post-transcriptional modification. It was recently shown that RNA transcripts may also undergo cleavage and secondary 5′ capping. Here, we show that post-transcriptional cleavage of RNA contributes to the diversification of the transcriptome by generating a range of small RNAs and long coding and noncoding RNAs. Using genome-wide histone modification and RNA polymerase II occupancy data, we confirm that the vast majority of intraexonic CAGE tags are derived from post-transcriptional processing. By comparing exonic CAGE tags to tissue-matched PARE data, we show that the cleavage and subsequent secondary capping is regulated in a developmental-stage- and tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, we find evidence of prevalent RNA cleavage in numerous transcriptomic data sets, including SAGE, cDNA, small RNA libraries, and deep-sequenced size-fractionated pools of RNA. These cleavage products include mRNA variants that retain the potential to be translated into shortened functional protein isoforms. We conclude that post-transcriptional RNA cleavage is a key mechanism that expands the functional repertoire and scope for regulatory control of the eukaryotic transcriptome.},

  abstract = {A human small nucleolar RNA, identified previously in HeLa cells by anti-fibrillarin autoantibody precipitation and termed RNA X, has been characterized. It comprises two uridine-rich variants (148 and 146 nucleotides), which we refer to as snRNA U15A and U15B. Secondary structure models predict for both variants a U15-specific stem-loop structure, as well as a new structural motif that contains conserved sequences and can also be recognized in the other fibrillarin-associated nucleolar snRNAs, U3, U14, and RNA Y. The single-copy gene for human U15A has been found unexpectedly to reside in intron 1 of the ribosomal protein S3 gene; the U15A sequence appears on the same strand as the S3 mRNA and does not exhibit canonical transcription signals for nuclear RNA polymerases. U15A RNA is processed in vitro from S3 intron 1 transcripts to yield the correct 5' end with a 5'-monophosphate; the in vitro system requires ATP for 3' cleavage, which occurs a few nucleotides downstream of the mature end. The production of a single primary transcript specifying the mRNA for a ribosomal or nucleolar protein and a nucleolar snRNA may constitute a general mechanism for balancing the levels of nucleolar components in vertebrate cells.},

To obtain a comprehensive view of a single transcription cycle, we switched on transcription of five long human genes (>100 kbp) with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and monitored (using microarrays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and chromatin immunoprecipitation) the appearance of nascent RNA, changes in binding of Pol II and two insulators (the cohesin subunit RAD21 and the CCCTC-binding factor CTCF), and modifications of histone H3. Activation triggers a wave of transcription that sweeps along the genes at ≈3.1 kbp/min; splicing occurs cotranscriptionally, a major checkpoint acts several kilobases downstream of the transcription start site to regulate polymerase transit, and Pol II tends to stall at cohesin/CTCF binding sites.},

  abstract = {Essential elements for intronic U14 processing have been analyzed by microinjecting various mutant hsc70/Ul4 pre-mRNA precursors into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Initial truncation experiments revealed that elements sufficient for U14 processing are located within the mature snoRNA sequence itself. Subsequent deletions within the U14 coding region demonstrated that only the terminal regions of the folded U14 molecule containing con- served nucleotide boxes C and D are required for processing. Mutagenesis of either box C or box D completely blocked U14 processing. The importance of boxes C and D was confirmed with the excision of appropriately sized U3 and U8 fragments containing boxes C and D from an hsc7O pre-mRNA intron. Competition studies indicate that a trans-acting factor (protein?) is binding this terminal motif and is essential for U14 processing. Competition studies also revealed that this factor is common to both intronic and non-intronic snoRNAs possessing nucleotide boxes C and D. Immunoprecipitation of full-length and internally deleted U14 snoRNA molecules demonstrated that the terminal region containing boxes C and D does not bind fibrillarin. Collectively, our results indicate that a trans-acting factor (different from fibrillarin) binds to the box C- and D-containing terminal motif of U14 snoRNA, thereby stabilizing the intronic snoRNA sequence in an RNP complex during processing.},

  abstract = {The major cell classes of the brain differ in their developmental processes, metabolism, signaling, and function. To better understand the functions and interactions of the cell types that comprise these classes, we acutely purified representative populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.},

  abstract      = {Author SummaryPrader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, is a complex neurogenetic disorder and the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity. Newborns have poor muscle tone, making suckling difficult, which leads to poor weight gain. After infancy, they experience extreme hunger, leading to obesity. Other symptoms include short stature, mental retardation, and often infertility. In PWS patients, a complex set of genes on the paternal chromosome 15 (in the PWS region) is missing or unexpressed. In an attempt to understand this disorder, various protein-coding genes in this region have been deleted in mice, but none of the resulting phenotypes consistently correlated with the human disease. This region also contains a cluster of genes that encode functional non-protein-coding RNAs. We deleted specifically the MBII-85 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) gene cluster on the parental mouse chromosome, which did not affect expression of any of the other snoRNA or protein-coding genes in the PWS region. These mice consistently displayed postnatal growth retardation starting from day 5 to 6, low postnatal lethality only in certain genetic backgrounds (<15%), and no adolescent obesity. Thus, this mouse model, with the deletion of a small, brain-specific non-protein-coding RNA, should prove useful for teasing out the various molecular pathologies of PWS.},

  abstract      = {Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the leading genetic cause of obesity. After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a ∼4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS. To test this hypothesis, we created a ∼150 kb deletion of the >40 copies of Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) in C57BL/6 mice. Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation.},

  abstract  = {HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning reads from RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of [sim]64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

RNA-seq experiments generate very large, complex data sets that demand fast, accurate and flexible software to reduce the raw read data to comprehensible results. HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts), StringTie and Ballgown are free, open-source software tools for comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq experiments. Together, they allow scientists to align reads to a genome, assemble transcripts including novel splice variants, compute the abundance of these transcripts in each sample and compare experiments to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts. This protocol describes all the steps necessary to process a large set of raw sequencing reads and create lists of gene transcripts, expression levels, and differentially expressed genes and transcripts. The protocol's execution time depends on the computing resources, but it typically takes under 45 min of computer time. HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown are available from http://ccb.jhu.edu/software.shtml.},

  abstract     = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

  abstract               = {Data visualization is an essential component of genomic data analysis. However, the size and diversity of the data sets produced by today’s sequencing and array-based profiling methods present major challenges to visualization tools. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems. IGV is freely available for download from http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv, under a GNU LGPL open-source license.},
