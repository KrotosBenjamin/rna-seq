In order to identify such factors, we have established sub-lines of STO feeder cells which exhibit variable ability in supporting ES cell self-renewal. Functional screening identifies WNT5A and WNT6 as STO cell-produced factors that potently inhibit ES cell differentiation in a serum-dependent manner. Furthermore, direct activation of beta-catenin without disturbing the upstream components of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway fully recapitulates the effect of WNTs on ES cells. Importantly, the WNT/beta-catenin pathway up-regulates the mRNA for Stat3, a known regulator of ES cell self-renewal in the mouse. Finally, LIF is able to mimic the serum effect to act synergistically with WNT proteins to inhibit ES cell differentiation. Therefore, our study reveals part of the molecular mechanisms by which the WNT/beta-catenin pathway acts to prevent ES cell differentiation through convergence on the LIF/JAK-STAT pathway at the level of STAT3.},

Recently, a second factor, Wnt, with similar activity was found. However, the relationship between these completely different signals mediating the overlapping functions is still unclear. Here, we report that the conditioned medium of L cells expressing Wnt3a maintains ES cells in the undifferentiated state in feeder-free culture, followed by expression of stem cell markers and their ability to generate germline chimaeras. However, although the activity of this conditioned medium is dependent on Wnt3a, recombinant Wnt3a protein cannot maintain ES cells in the undifferentiated state. As supplementation with Wnt3a to the sub-threshold level of LIF alone was not sufficient to maintain ES self-renewal, the results of maintenance of the undifferentiated state indicated the synergistic action of Wnt and LIF. Induction of constitutively activated beta-catenin alone is unable to maintain ES self-renewal but shows a synergistic effect with LIF. These observations indicate that the Wnt signal mediated by the canonical pathway is not sufficient but enhances the effect of LIF to maintain self-renewal of mouse ES cells.},

They provide both a cellular vector for the generation of transgenic animals and a useful system for the identification of polypeptide factors controlling differentiation processes in early development. In particular, medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells contains a polypeptide factor, ES cell differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA), which specifically suppresses the spontaneous differentiation of ES cells in vitro, thereby permitting their growth as homogeneous stem cell populations in the absence of heterologous feeder cells. ES cell pluripotentiality, including the ability to give rise to functional gametes, is preserved after prolonged culture in Buffalo rat liver media as a source of DIA. Here, we report that purified DIA is related in structure and function to the recently identified hematopoietic regulatory factors human interleukin for DA cells and leukaemia inhibitory factor. DIA and human interleukin DA/leukaemia inhibitory factor have thus been identified as related multifunctional regulatory factors with distinct biological activities in both early embryonic and hematopoietic stem cell systems.},

This effect has variously been attributed to stimulation of Wnt signalling by beta-catenin, stabilization of Myc protein and global de-inhibition of anabolic processes. Here we demonstrate that beta-catenin is not necessary for embryonic stem cell identity or expansion, but its absence eliminates the self-renewal response to Gsk3 inhibition. Responsiveness is fully restored by truncated beta-catenin lacking the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain. However, requirement for Gsk3 inhibition is dictated by expression of T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) and mediated by direct interaction with beta-catenin. Tcf3 localizes to many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells. Our findings confirm that Tcf3 acts as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that beta-catenin directly abrogates Tcf3 function. We conclude that Gsk3 inhibition stabilizes the embryonic stem cell state primarily by reducing repressive influence on the core pluripotency network.},

  abstract =  {Direct differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into functional motor neurons represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, to screen new drug compounds, and to develop new therapies for motor neuron diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Many current protocols use a combination of retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog (Shh) to differentiate mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells into motor neurons(1-4). However, the differentiation efficiency of mES cells into motor neurons has only met with moderate success. We have developed a two-step differentiation protocol(5) that significantly improves the differentiation efficiency compared with currently established protocols. The first step is to enhance the neuralization process by adding Noggin and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Noggin is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and is implicated in neural induction according to the default model of neurogenesis and results in the formation of anterior neural patterning(6). FGF signaling acts synergistically with Noggin in inducing neural tissue formation by promoting a posterior neural identity(7-9). In this step, mES cells were primed with Noggin, bFGF, and FGF-8 for two days to promote differentiation towards neural lineages. The second step is to induce motor neuron specification. Noggin/FGFs exposed mES cells were incubated with RA and a Shh agonist, Smoothened agonist (SAG), for another 5 days to facilitate motor neuron generation. To monitor the differentiation of mESs into motor neurons, we used an ES cell line derived from a transgenic mouse expressing eGFP under the control of the motor neuron specific promoter Hb9(1). Using this robust protocol, we achieved 51±0.8\% of differentiation efficiency (n = 3; p < 0.01, Student's t-test)(5). Results from immunofluorescent staining showed that GFP+ cells express the motor neuron specific markers, Islet-1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Our two-step differentiation protocol provides an efficient way to differentiate mES cells into spinal motor neurons.},

Due to the lethality of these toxins, there are elevated concerns regarding their possible use as bioterrorism agents. Moreover, their widespread use for cosmetic purposes, and as medical treatments, has increased the potential risk of accidental overdosing and environmental exposure. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel modalities to counter BoNT intoxication. Mammalian motoneurons are the main target of BoNTs, however, due to the difficulty and poor efficiency of the procedures required to isolate the cells, they are not suitable for high-throughput drug screening assays. Here, we explored the suitability of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived motoneurons as a renewable, reproducible, and physiologically relevant system for BoNT studies. We found that the sensitivity of ES-derived motoneurons to BoNT/A intoxication is comparable to that of primary mouse spinal motoneurons. Additionally, we demonstrated that several BoNT/A inhibitors protected SNAP-25, the BoNT/A substrate, in the ES-derived motoneuron system. Furthermore, this system is compatible with immunofluorescence-based high-throughput studies. These data suggest that ES-derived motoneurons provide a highly sensitive system that is amenable to large-scale screenings to rapidly identify and evaluate the biological efficacies of novel therapeutics.},

  abstract ={The ability of axons to grow through tissue in vivo during development or regeneration may be regulated by the availability of specific neurite-promoting macromolecules located within the extracellular matrix. We have used tissue culture methods to examine the relative ability of various extracellular matrix components to elicit neurite outgrowth from dissociated chick embryo parasympathetic (ciliary ganglion) neurons in serum-free monolayer culture. Purified laminin from both mouse and rat sources, as well as a partially purified polyornithine-binding neurite promoting factor (PNPF-1) from rat Schwannoma cells all stimulate neurite production from these neurons. Laminin and PNPF-1 are also potent stimulators of neurite growth from cultured neurons obtained from other peripheral as well as central neural tissues, specifically avian sympathetic and sensory ganglia and spinal cord, optic tectum, neural retina, and telencephalon, as well as from sensory ganglia of the neonatal mouse and hippocampal, septal, and striatal tissues of the fetal rat. A quantitative in vitro bioassay method using ciliary neurons was used to (a) measure and compare the specific neurite-promoting activities of these agents, (b) confirm that during the purification of laminin, the neurite-promoting activity co-purifies with the laminin protein, and (c) compare the influences of antilaminin antibodies on the neurite-promoting activity of laminin and PNPF-1. We conclude that laminin and PNPF-1 are distinct macromolecules capable of expressing their neurite-promoting activities even when presented in nanogram amounts. This neurite-promoting bioassay currently represents the most sensitive test for the biological activity of laminin.},

  abstract =      {Neurite growth cones detect and respond to guidance cues in their local environment that determine stereotyped pathways during development and regeneration. Micropatterns of laminin (which was found to adsorb preferentially to photolithographically defined hydrophobic areas of micropatterns) were here used to model adhesive pathways that might influence neurite extension. The responses of growth cones were determined by the degree of guidance of neurite extension and also by examining growth cone morphology. These parameters were found to be strongly dependent on the geometry of the patterned laminin, and on neuron type. Decreasing the spacing of multiple parallel tracks of laminin alternating with non-adhesive tracks, resulted in decreased guidance of chick embryo brain neurons. Single isolated 2 microns tracks strongly guided neurite extension whereas 2 microns tracks forming a 4 microns period multiple parallel pattern did not. Growth cones appear to be capable of bridging the narrow non-adhesive tracks, rendering them insensitive to the smaller period multiple parallel adhesive patterns. These observations suggest that growth cones would be unresponsive to the multiple adhesive cues such as would be presented by oriented extracellular matrix or certain axon fascicle structures, but could be guided by isolated adhesive tracks. Growth cone morphology became progressively simpler on progressively narrower single tracks. On narrow period multiple parallel tracks (which did not guide neurite extension) growth cones spanned a number of adhesive/non-adhesive tracks, and their morphology suggests that lamellipodial advance may be independent of the substratum by using filopodia as a scaffold. In addition to acting as guidance cues, laminin micropatterns also appeared to influence the production of primary neurites and their subsequent branching. On planar substrata, dorsal root ganglion neurons were multipolar, with highly branched neurite outgrowth whereas, on 25 microns tracks, neurite branching was reduced or absent, and neuron morphology was typically bipolar. These observations indicate the precision with which growth cone advance may be controlled by substrata and suggest a role for patterned adhesiveness in neuronal morphological differentiation, but also highlight some of the limitations of growth cone sensitivity to substratum cues.},

  abstract =      {Neurons are one of the highly polarized cells in the body. One of the fundamental issues in neuroscience is how neurons establish their polarity; therefore, this issue fascinates many scientists. Cultured neurons are useful tools for analyzing the mechanisms of neuronal polarization, and indeed, most of the molecules important in their polarization were identified using culture systems. However, we now know that the process of neuronal polarization in vivo differs in some respects from that in cultured neurons. One of the major differences is their surrounding microenvironment; neurons in vivo can be influenced by extrinsic factors from the microenvironment. Therefore, a major question remains: How are neurons polarized in vivo? Here, we begin by reviewing the process of neuronal polarization in culture conditions and in vivo. We also survey the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal polarization. Finally, we introduce the theoretical basis of neuronal polarization and the possible involvement of neuronal polarity in disease and traumatic brain injury.},

The axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) emerge basally in vivo, yet because RGCs develop from polarized neuroepithelial cells within a polarized environment, disentangling intrinsic and extrinsic influences is a challenge. We use time-lapse imaging to demonstrate that Laminin acting directly on RGCs is necessary and sufficient to orient axon emergence in vivo. Laminin contact with the basal processes of newborn RGCs prevents the cells from entering a stochastic Stage 2 phase, directs the rapid accumulation of the early axonal marker Kif5c560-YFP, and leads to the formation of axonal growth cones. These results suggest that contact-mediated cues may be critical for the site of axon emergence and account for the differences in cellular behavior observed in vitro and in vivo.

  abstract =      {<p>Polymerization and organization of actin filaments into complex superstructures is indispensable for structure and function of neuronal networks. We here report that knock down of the F-actin-binding protein Abp1, which is important for endocytosis and synaptic organization, results in changes in axon development virtually identical to Arp2/3 complex inhibition, i.e., a selective increase of axon length. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that Abp1 interacts directly with N-WASP, an activator of the Arp2/3 complex, <italic>and</italic> releases the autoinhibition of N-WASP in cooperation with Cdc42 and thereby promotes N-WASP-triggered Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. In line with our mechanistical studies and the colocalization of Abp1, N-WASP and Arp2/3 at sites of actin polymerization in neurons, we reveal an essential role of Abp1 and its cooperativity with Cdc42 in N-WASP-induced rearrangements of the neuronal cytoskeleton. We furthermore show that introduction of N-WASP mutants lacking the ability to bind Abp1 or Cdc42, Arp2/3 complex inhibition, Abp1 knock down, N-WASP knock down and Arp3 knock down, all cause identical neuromorphological phenotypes. Our data thus strongly suggest that these proteins and their complex formation are important for cytoskeletal processes underlying neuronal network formation.</p>},
