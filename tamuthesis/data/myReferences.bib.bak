Cases of PWS patients with a deletion encompassing the SNORD116 gene cluster, but preserving the expression of flanking genes, have been described. We report a 23-year-old woman who presented clinical criteria of PWS, including the behavioural and nutritional features, obesity, developmental delay and endocrine dysfunctions with hyperghrelinemia. We found a paternally transmitted highly restricted deletion of the SNORD116 gene cluster, the shortest described to date (118 kb). This deletion was also present in the father. This finding in a human case strongly supports the current hypothesis that lack of the paternal SNORD116 gene cluster has a determinant role in the pathogenesis of PWS.

  abstract  = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an essential class of molecular species that have been difficult to monitor on high throughput platforms due to frequent lack of polyadenylation. Using a polyadenylation-neutral amplification protocol and next-generation sequencing, we explore ncRNA expression in eleven human tissues. ncRNAs 7SL, U2, 7SK, and HBII-52 are expressed at levels far exceeding mRNAs. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with rRNA methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively: spleen expresses both, hypothalamus expresses mainly C/D box snoRNAs, and testes show enriched expression of both H/ACA box snoRNAs and RNA telomerase TERC. Within the snoRNA 14q cluster, 14q(I-6) is expressed at much higher levels than other cluster members. More reads align to mitochondrial than nuclear tRNAs. Many lincRNAs are actively transcribed, particularly those overlapping known ncRNAs. Within the Prader-Willi syndrome loci, the snoRNA HBII-85 (group I) cluster is highly expressed in hypothalamus, greater than in other tissues and greater than group II or III. Additionally, within the disease locus we find novel transcription across a 400,000 nt span in ovaries. This genome-wide polyA-neutral expression compendium demonstrates the richness of ncRNA expression, their high expression patterns, their function-specific expression patterns, and is publicly available.},

  abstract  = {Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly /`housekeeping/', whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.},

Most of the U-snRNAs have 5'-terminal caps added to the end of the primary transcript. Here we describe two variants of a snRNA, called U17, identified in human HeLa cells. U17 RNA may be involved in ribosome biogenesis since it is found in the nucleolus and sediments with 40S structures possibly representing nascent ribosomal subunits. U17 RNAs contain no cap but have a monophosphate at the 5'-terminus indicating that they are processed from longer precursors. The U17 RNAs are encoded within introns 1 and 2 of the single copy gene RCC1 which codes for an important cell cycle regulatory protein. In HeLa cell S-100 extract, U17 RNA is faithfully excised from a longer RNA transcript derived from the intron yielding 5'-monophosphorylated RNA. These data suggest that U17 RNAs are not independently transcribed but are processed out of the RCC1 pre-mRNA or out of the spliced introns. IMAGES:},

  abstract = {The complexity of the eukaryotic transcriptome is generated by the interplay of transcription initiation, termination, alternative splicing, and other forms of post-transcriptional modification. It was recently shown that RNA transcripts may also undergo cleavage and secondary 5′ capping. Here, we show that post-transcriptional cleavage of RNA contributes to the diversification of the transcriptome by generating a range of small RNAs and long coding and noncoding RNAs. Using genome-wide histone modification and RNA polymerase II occupancy data, we confirm that the vast majority of intraexonic CAGE tags are derived from post-transcriptional processing. By comparing exonic CAGE tags to tissue-matched PARE data, we show that the cleavage and subsequent secondary capping is regulated in a developmental-stage- and tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, we find evidence of prevalent RNA cleavage in numerous transcriptomic data sets, including SAGE, cDNA, small RNA libraries, and deep-sequenced size-fractionated pools of RNA. These cleavage products include mRNA variants that retain the potential to be translated into shortened functional protein isoforms. We conclude that post-transcriptional RNA cleavage is a key mechanism that expands the functional repertoire and scope for regulatory control of the eukaryotic transcriptome.},

  abstract  = {Author SummaryPrader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, is a complex neurogenetic disorder and the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity. Newborns have poor muscle tone, making suckling difficult, which leads to poor weight gain. After infancy, they experience extreme hunger, leading to obesity. Other symptoms include short stature, mental retardation, and often infertility. In PWS patients, a complex set of genes on the paternal chromosome 15 (in the PWS region) is missing or unexpressed. In an attempt to understand this disorder, various protein-coding genes in this region have been deleted in mice, but none of the resulting phenotypes consistently correlated with the human disease. This region also contains a cluster of genes that encode functional non-protein-coding RNAs. We deleted specifically the MBII-85 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) gene cluster on the parental mouse chromosome, which did not affect expression of any of the other snoRNA or protein-coding genes in the PWS region. These mice consistently displayed postnatal growth retardation starting from day 5 to 6, low postnatal lethality only in certain genetic backgrounds (<15%), and no adolescent obesity. Thus, this mouse model, with the deletion of a small, brain-specific non-protein-coding RNA, should prove useful for teasing out the various molecular pathologies of PWS.},

  abstract = {A human small nucleolar RNA, identified previously in HeLa cells by anti-fibrillarin autoantibody precipitation and termed RNA X, has been characterized. It comprises two uridine-rich variants (148 and 146 nucleotides), which we refer to as snRNA U15A and U15B. Secondary structure models predict for both variants a U15-specific stem-loop structure, as well as a new structural motif that contains conserved sequences and can also be recognized in the other fibrillarin-associated nucleolar snRNAs, U3, U14, and RNA Y. The single-copy gene for human U15A has been found unexpectedly to reside in intron 1 of the ribosomal protein S3 gene; the U15A sequence appears on the same strand as the S3 mRNA and does not exhibit canonical transcription signals for nuclear RNA polymerases. U15A RNA is processed in vitro from S3 intron 1 transcripts to yield the correct 5' end with a 5'-monophosphate; the in vitro system requires ATP for 3' cleavage, which occurs a few nucleotides downstream of the mature end. The production of a single primary transcript specifying the mRNA for a ribosomal or nucleolar protein and a nucleolar snRNA may constitute a general mechanism for balancing the levels of nucleolar components in vertebrate cells.},

To obtain a comprehensive view of a single transcription cycle, we switched on transcription of five long human genes (>100 kbp) with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and monitored (using microarrays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and chromatin immunoprecipitation) the appearance of nascent RNA, changes in binding of Pol II and two insulators (the cohesin subunit RAD21 and the CCCTC-binding factor CTCF), and modifications of histone H3. Activation triggers a wave of transcription that sweeps along the genes at ≈3.1 kbp/min; splicing occurs cotranscriptionally, a major checkpoint acts several kilobases downstream of the transcription start site to regulate polymerase transit, and Pol II tends to stall at cohesin/CTCF binding sites.},

  abstract = {Essential elements for intronic U14 processing have been analyzed by microinjecting various mutant hsc70/Ul4 pre-mRNA precursors into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Initial truncation experiments revealed that elements sufficient for U14 processing are located within the mature snoRNA sequence itself. Subsequent deletions within the U14 coding region demonstrated that only the terminal regions of the folded U14 molecule containing con- served nucleotide boxes C and D are required for processing. Mutagenesis of either box C or box D completely blocked U14 processing. The importance of boxes C and D was confirmed with the excision of appropriately sized U3 and U8 fragments containing boxes C and D from an hsc7O pre-mRNA intron. Competition studies indicate that a trans-acting factor (protein?) is binding this terminal motif and is essential for U14 processing. Competition studies also revealed that this factor is common to both intronic and non-intronic snoRNAs possessing nucleotide boxes C and D. Immunoprecipitation of full-length and internally deleted U14 snoRNA molecules demonstrated that the terminal region containing boxes C and D does not bind fibrillarin. Collectively, our results indicate that a trans-acting factor (different from fibrillarin) binds to the box C- and D-containing terminal motif of U14 snoRNA, thereby stabilizing the intronic snoRNA sequence in an RNP complex during processing.},

To better understand the functions and interactions of the cell types that comprise these classes, we acutely purified representative populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.},

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. Results: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

  abstract  = {HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning reads from RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of [sim]64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

RNA-seq experiments generate very large, complex data sets that demand fast, accurate and flexible software to reduce the raw read data to comprehensible results. HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts), StringTie and Ballgown are free, open-source software tools for comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq experiments. Together, they allow scientists to align reads to a genome, assemble transcripts including novel splice variants, compute the abundance of these transcripts in each sample and compare experiments to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts. This protocol describes all the steps necessary to process a large set of raw sequencing reads and create lists of gene transcripts, expression levels, and differentially expressed genes and transcripts. The protocol's execution time depends on the computing resources, but it typically takes under 45 min of computer time. HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown are available from http://ccb.jhu.edu/software.shtml.},

  abstract     = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

  abstract               = {Data visualization is an essential component of genomic data analysis. However, the size and diversity of the data sets produced by today’s sequencing and array-based profiling methods present major challenges to visualization tools. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems. IGV is freely available for download from http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv, under a GNU LGPL open-source license.},

When these cell lines are converted to IgM-secreting cells by fusion with a myeloma cell, the 64K form of ? predominates; thus it is designated ?s (?-secreted). The 67K form correlates with the presence of surface IgM; thus it is designated ?m (?-membrane). Cells that make both forms of ? chain have two mRNAs, one of 2.4 kb that encodes ?s and one of 2.7 kb that encodes ?m. The difference between the ?s and ?m mRNAs can be localized to their 3? ends by hybridizing 32P-cDNA copies of the mRNA to a cloned copy of ?s mRNA, treating the mixtures with SI nuclease, and resolving the nuclease-resistant duplexes by electrophoresis. By probing the separated species of RNA with a DNA copy of the 3? untranslated region of ?s mRNA, it was shown that the 3? ends of the two ? mRNAs do not cross-hybridize. The difference between the two RNAs was mapped to the 3? edge of the C?4 domain. Apparently two separate 3? terminal sequences for ? mRNA are encoded in the genome, one that specifies an amino acid sequence appropriate for membrane-binding and a second that is involved in secretion. At different stages of immunocyte development, different ? mRNAs predominate: ?m during the lymphocyte stages and ?s during the secretion stages.

  abstract      = {Point mutations frequently cause genetic diseases by disrupting the correct pattern of pre-mRNA splicing. The effect of a point mutation within a coding sequence is traditionally attributed to the deduced change in the corresponding amino acid. However, some point mutations can have much more severe effects on the structure of the encoded protein, for example when they inactivate an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), thereby resulting in exon skipping. ESEs also appear to be especially important in exons that normally undergo alternative splicing. Different classes of ESE consensus motifs have beena described, but they are not always easily identified. ESEfinder (http://exon.cshl.edu/ESE/) is a web-based resource that facilitates rapid analysis of exon sequences to identify putative ESEs responsive to the human SR proteins SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40 and SRp55, and to predict whether exonic mutations disrupt such elements.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (bfCNs) which provide innervation to the hippocampus and cortex, are required for memory and learning, and are primarily affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), resulting in related cognitive decline. Therefore generation of a source of bfCNs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is crucial for in vitro disease modeling and development of novel \{AD\} therapies. In addition, for the advancement of regenerative approaches there is a requirement for an accurate developmental model to study the neurogenesis and survival of this population. Here we demonstrate the efficient production of bfCNs, using a novel embryoid body (EB) based non-adherent differentiation (NAdD) protocol. We establish a specific basal forebrain neural stem cell (NSC) phenotype via expression of the basal forebrain transcription factors NKX2.1 and LHX8, as well as the general forebrain marker FOXG1. We present evidence that this lineage is achieved via recapitulation of embryonic events, with induction of intrinsic hedgehog signaling, through the use of a 3D non-adherent differentiation system. This is the first example of hPSC-derived basal forebrain-like NSCs, which are scalable via self-renewal in prolonged culture. Furthermore upon terminal differentiation these basal forebrain-like \{NSCs\} generate high numbers of cholinergic neurons expressing the specific markers ChAT, \{VACht\} and ISL1. These hPSC-derived bfCNs possess characteristics that are crucial in a model to study \{AD\} related cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain. Examples are expression of the therapeutic target p75NTR, the release of acetylcholine, and demonstration of a mature, and functional electrophysiological profile. In conclusion, this work provides a renewable source of human functional bfCNs applicable for studying \{AD\} specifically in the cholinergic system, and also provides a model of the key embryonic events in human bfCN development. },

In this review, we describe principles of miRNA-mRNA interactions and proteins that interact with miRNAs and function in miRNA-mediated repression. We discuss the multiple, often contradictory, mechanisms that miRNAs have been reported to use, which cause translational repression and mRNA decay. We also address the issue of cellular localization of miRNA-mediated events and a role for RNA-binding proteins in activation or relief of miRNA repression. },

The specificity of the enzyme for DNA-RNA hybrids is indicated by several lines of evidence: The RNA of the hybrid is rendered resistant to the action of this enzyme upon heating. Nucleic acids other than DNA-RNA hybrids are not affected to a comparable degree. The enzyme rapidly degrades polyribouridylic acid if it is hybridized to polydeoxyriboadenylic acid, but not if it is hybridized to polyriboadenylic acid. Experiments with double labelled DNA-RNA hybrids show that specifically the RNA moiety of the hybrid and not the DNA is attacked by the enzyme.},

Here, we have directly compared the neural-differentiation capacity of human iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We have shown that human iPSCs use the same transcriptional network to generate neuroepithelia and functionally appropriate neuronal types over the same developmental time course as hESCs in response to the same set of morphogens; however, they do it with significantly reduced efficiency and increased variability. These results were consistent across iPSC lines and independent of the set of reprogramming transgenes used to derive iPSCs as well as the presence or absence of reprogramming transgenes in iPSCs. These findings, which show a need for improving differentiation potency of iPSCs, suggest the possibility of employing human iPSCs in pathological studies, therapeutic screening, and autologous cell transplantation.},

  abstract      = {As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display becomes critical. A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided athttp://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000 different users.},

For cases with a deletion mutation, the “reading frame” hypothesis predicts that BMD patients produce a semifunctional, internally deleted dystrophin protein, whereas DMD patients produce a severely truncated protein that would be unstable. To test the validity of this theory, we analyzed 258 independent deletions at the DMD/BMD locus. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutation is in agreement with the “reading frame” theory in 92\% of cases and is of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The distribution and frequency of deletions spanning the entire locus suggests that many “in-frame” deletions of the dystrophin gene are not detected because the individuals bearing them are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features.

The ability to manipulate alternative splicing using antisense oligonucleotides, as demonstrated in several studies during the past year, makes it an important and attractive approach to altering gene expression. A review of these studies leads to the conclusion that antisense oligonucleotides, whether designed to affect the cytoplasmic mRNA or nuclear pre-mRNA, function predominantly in the nucleus and not the cytoplasm.},

  abstract      = {Expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is under tight regulation to accommodate its intricate roles in controlling brain function. Transcription of BDNF initiates from multiple promoters in response to distinct stimulation cues. However, regardless which promoter is used, all BDNF transcripts are processed at two alternative polyadenylation sites, generating two pools of mRNAs that carry either a long or a short 3′UTR, both encoding the same BDNF protein. Whether and how the two distinct 3′UTRs may differentially regulate BDNF translation in response to neuronal activity changes is an intriguing and challenging question. We report here that the long BDNF 3′UTR is a bona fide cis-acting translation suppressor at rest whereas the short 3′UTR mediates active translation to maintain basal levels of BDNF protein production. Upon neuronal activation, the long BDNF 3′UTR, but not the short 3′UTR, imparts rapid and robust activation of translation from a reporter. Importantly, the endogenous long 3′UTR BDNF mRNA specifically undergoes markedly enhanced polyribosome association in the hippocampus in response to pilocarpine induced-seizure before transcriptional up-regulation of BDNF. Furthermore, BDNF protein level is quickly increased in the hippocampus upon seizure-induced neuronal activation, accompanied by a robust activation of the tropomyosin-related receptor tyrosine kinase B. These observations reveal a mechanism for activity-dependent control of BDNF translation and tropomyosin-related receptor tyrosine kinase B signaling in brain neurons.},

  abstract      = {Deletions giving rise to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the less severe Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) occur in the same large gene on the short arm of the human X chromosome. We present a molecular mechanism to explain the clinical difference in serity between \{DMD\} and \{BMD\} patients who bear partial deletions of the same gene locus. The model is based on the breakpoints of intragenic deletions and their effect on the translation of triplet codons into amino acids of the protein product. Deletions identified in three \{DMD\} patients are shown to shift the translational open reading frame (ORF) of triplet codons for amino acids, and each deletion is predicted to result in a truncated, abnormal protein product. Deletions identified in three \{BMD\} patients are shown to maintain the translational \{ORF\} for amino acids and predict a shorter, lower molecular weight protein. The smaller protein product is presumed to be semifunctional and to result in a milder clinical phenotype. The same \{ORF\} mechanism is also applicable to potential 5′ and 3′ intron splice mutations and their effect on protein production and clinical phenotype. },

  abstract      = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, localization, and translation are largely determined by sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). We found a conserved increase in expression of mRNAs terminating at upstream polyadenylation sites after activation of primary murine CD4+ T lymphocytes. This program, resulting in shorter 3'UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3'UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3'UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs.},

We previously derived position weight matrices to predict putative ESEs specific for four human SR proteins. The score matrices are part of ESEfinder, an online resource to identify ESEs in query sequences. We have now carried out a refined functional SELEX screen for motifs that can act as ESEs in response to the human SR protein SF2/ASF. The test BRCA1 exon under selection was internal, rather than the 3′-terminal IGHM exon used in our earlier studies. A naturally occurring heptameric ESE in BRCA1 exon 18 was replaced with two libraries of random sequences, one seven nucleotides in length, the other 14. Following three rounds of selection for in vitro splicing via internal exon inclusion, new consensus motifs and score matrices were derived. Many winner sequences were demonstrated to be functional ESEs in S100-extract-complementation assays with recombinant SF2/ASF. Motif-score threshold values were derived from both experimental and statistical analyses. Motif scores were shown to correlate with levels of exon inclusion, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm and extend our earlier data, as many of the same motifs are recognized as ESEs by both the original and our new score matrix, despite the different context used for selection. Finally, we have derived an increased specificity score matrix that incorporates information from both of our SF2/ASF-specific matrices and that accurately predicts the exon-skipping phenotypes of deleterious point mutations.},

Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas.

  abstract      = {mRNA polyadenylation and pre-mRNA splicing are two essential steps for the maturation of most human mRNAs. Studies have shown that some genes generate mRNA variants involving both alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Polyadenylation in introns can lead to conversion of an internal exon to a 3′ terminal exon, which is termed composite terminal exon, or usage of a 3′ terminal exon that is otherwise skipped, which is termed skipped terminal exon. Using cDNA/EST and genome sequences, we identified polyadenylation sites in introns for all currently known human genes. We found that ∼20\% human genes have at least one intronic polyadenylation event that can potentially lead to mRNA variants, most of which encode different protein products. The conservation of human intronic poly(A) sites in mouse and rat genomes is lower than that of poly(A) sites in 3′-most exons. Quantitative analysis of a number of mRNA variants generated by intronic poly(A) sites suggests that the intronic polyadenylation activity can vary under different cellular conditions for most genes. Furthermore, we found that weak 5′ splice site and large intron size are the determining factors controlling the usage of composite terminal exon poly(A) sites, whereas skipped terminal exon poly(A) sites tend to be associated with strong polyadenylation signals. Thus, our data indicate that dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing leads to widespread polyadenylation in introns and contributes to the complexity of transcriptome in the cell.},

These induced pluripotent human stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. Such induced pluripotent human cell lines should be useful in the production of new disease models and in drug development, as well as for applications in transplantation medicine, once technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral integration) are eliminated.},

However, imprinted genes in mammals display parent of origin-specific monoallelic expression. As some imprinted genes play essential roles in mammalian development, the reason why mammals adopted the genomic imprinting mechanism has been a mystery since its discovery. In this review, based on the recent studies on imprinted gene regulation we discuss several advantageous features of a monoallelic expression mechanism and the necessity of genomic imprinting in the current mammalian developmental system. We further speculate how the present genomic imprinting system has been established during mammalian evolution by the mechanism of complementation between paternal and maternal genomes under evolutionary pressure predicted by the genetic conflict hypothesis.},

Here we have studied the effects of activity on synapse formation between hippocampal dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons in culture, taking advantage of FM1-43 as a fluorescent marker of synaptic boutons. We observed an early tendency for synapses to group together, quickly followed by the appearance of synaptic clusters on dendritic processes. These events were strongly influenced by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor- and cyclic AMP-dependent signaling. The microstructure and localization of the synaptic clusters resembled that found in hippocampus, at mossy fiber synapses of stratum lucidum. Activity-dependent clustering of synapses represents a means for synaptic targeting that might contribute to synaptic organization in the brain.},

Ubiquitination of proteins requires the sequential action of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and in some cases ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). The oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 utilize this cellular proteolytic system to target the tumor suppressor protein p53. The HPV E6 oncoprotein binds to a cellular protein of 100 kd, termed E6-associated protein (E6-AP). The E6-E6-AP complex specifically interacts with p53, resulting in the rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. Here we report the purification and identification of the factors necessary for the E6-E6-AP-mediated ubiquitination of p53. The ubiquitination of p53 requires the E1 enzyme and a novel E2 in mammalian cells, while E3 activity is conferred by the E6-E6-AP complex. Furthermore, E6-AP appears to have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in the absence of E6.},

  abstract      = {Neurite growth cones detect and respond to guidance cues in their local environment that determine stereotyped pathways during development and regeneration. Micropatterns of laminin (which was found to adsorb preferentially to photolithographically defined hydrophobic areas of micropatterns) were here used to model adhesive pathways that might influence neurite extension. The responses of growth cones were determined by the degree of guidance of neurite extension and also by examining growth cone morphology. These parameters were found to be strongly dependent on the geometry of the patterned laminin, and on neuron type. Decreasing the spacing of multiple parallel tracks of laminin alternating with non-adhesive tracks, resulted in decreased guidance of chick embryo brain neurons. Single isolated 2 microns tracks strongly guided neurite extension whereas 2 microns tracks forming a 4 microns period multiple parallel pattern did not. Growth cones appear to be capable of bridging the narrow non-adhesive tracks, rendering them insensitive to the smaller period multiple parallel adhesive patterns. These observations suggest that growth cones would be unresponsive to the multiple adhesive cues such as would be presented by oriented extracellular matrix or certain axon fascicle structures, but could be guided by isolated adhesive tracks. Growth cone morphology became progressively simpler on progressively narrower single tracks. On narrow period multiple parallel tracks (which did not guide neurite extension) growth cones spanned a number of adhesive/non-adhesive tracks, and their morphology suggests that lamellipodial advance may be independent of the substratum by using filopodia as a scaffold. In addition to acting as guidance cues, laminin micropatterns also appeared to influence the production of primary neurites and their subsequent branching. On planar substrata, dorsal root ganglion neurons were multipolar, with highly branched neurite outgrowth whereas, on 25 microns tracks, neurite branching was reduced or absent, and neuron morphology was typically bipolar. These observations indicate the precision with which growth cone advance may be controlled by substrata and suggest a role for patterned adhesiveness in neuronal morphological differentiation, but also highlight some of the limitations of growth cone sensitivity to substratum cues.},

Approximately one third of the cystic embryoid bodies develop myocardium and when cultured in the presence of human cord serum, 30\% develop blood islands, thereby exhibiting a high level of organized development at a very high frequency. Furthermore, most embryonic stem cell lines observed exhibit similar characteristics.

Furthermore, direct activation of beta-catenin without disturbing the upstream components of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway fully recapitulates the effect of WNTs on ES cells. Importantly, the WNT/beta-catenin pathway up-regulates the mRNA for Stat3, a known regulator of ES cell self-renewal in the mouse. Finally, LIF is able to mimic the serum effect to act synergistically with WNT proteins to inhibit ES cell differentiation. Therefore, our study reveals part of the molecular mechanisms by which the WNT/beta-catenin pathway acts to prevent ES cell differentiation through convergence on the LIF/JAK-STAT pathway at the level of STAT3.},

  abstract      = {Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) inhibit cholinergic synaptic transmission by specifically cleaving proteins that are crucial for neurotransmitter exocytosis. Due to the lethality of these toxins, there are elevated concerns regarding their possible use as bioterrorism agents. Moreover, their widespread use for cosmetic purposes, and as medical treatments, has increased the potential risk of accidental overdosing and environmental exposure. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel modalities to counter BoNT intoxication. Mammalian motoneurons are the main target of BoNTs, however, due to the difficulty and poor efficiency of the procedures required to isolate the cells, they are not suitable for high-throughput drug screening assays. Here, we explored the suitability of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived motoneurons as a renewable, reproducible, and physiologically relevant system for BoNT studies. We found that the sensitivity of ES-derived motoneurons to BoNT/A intoxication is comparable to that of primary mouse spinal motoneurons. Additionally, we demonstrated that several BoNT/A inhibitors protected SNAP-25, the BoNT/A substrate, in the ES-derived motoneuron system. Furthermore, this system is compatible with immunofluorescence-based high-throughput studies. These data suggest that ES-derived motoneurons provide a highly sensitive system that is amenable to large-scale screenings to rapidly identify and evaluate the biological efficacies of novel therapeutics.},

We have used tissue culture methods to examine the relative ability of various extracellular matrix components to elicit neurite outgrowth from dissociated chick embryo parasympathetic (ciliary ganglion) neurons in serum-free monolayer culture. Purified laminin from both mouse and rat sources, as well as a partially purified polyornithine-binding neurite promoting factor (PNPF-1) from rat Schwannoma cells all stimulate neurite production from these neurons. Laminin and PNPF-1 are also potent stimulators of neurite growth from cultured neurons obtained from other peripheral as well as central neural tissues, specifically avian sympathetic and sensory ganglia and spinal cord, optic tectum, neural retina, and telencephalon, as well as from sensory ganglia of the neonatal mouse and hippocampal, septal, and striatal tissues of the fetal rat. A quantitative in vitro bioassay method using ciliary neurons was used to (a) measure and compare the specific neurite-promoting activities of these agents, (b) confirm that during the purification of laminin, the neurite-promoting activity co-purifies with the laminin protein, and (c) compare the influences of antilaminin antibodies on the neurite-promoting activity of laminin and PNPF-1. We conclude that laminin and PNPF-1 are distinct macromolecules capable of expressing their neurite-promoting activities even when presented in nanogram amounts. This neurite-promoting bioassay currently represents the most sensitive test for the biological activity of laminin.},

The pluripotency of these embryonic stem cells was demonstrated conclusively by the observation that subclonal cultures, derived from isolated single cells, can differentiate into a wide variety of cell types. Such embryonic stem cells were isolated from inner cell masses of late blastocysts cultured in medium conditioned by an established teratocarcinoma stem cell line. This suggests that such conditioned medium might contain a growth factor that stimulates the proliferation or inhibits the differentiation of normal pluripotent embryonic cells, or both. This method of obtaining embryonic stem cells makes feasible the isolation of pluripotent cells lines from various types of noninbred embryo, including those carrying mutant genes. The availability of such cell lines should made possible new approaches to the study of early mammalian development.},

One of the fundamental issues in neuroscience is how neurons establish their polarity; therefore, this issue fascinates many scientists. Cultured neurons are useful tools for analyzing the mechanisms of neuronal polarization, and indeed, most of the molecules important in their polarization were identified using culture systems. However, we now know that the process of neuronal polarization in vivo differs in some respects from that in cultured neurons. One of the major differences is their surrounding microenvironment; neurons in vivo can be influenced by extrinsic factors from the microenvironment. Therefore, a major question remains: How are neurons polarized in vivo? Here, we begin by reviewing the process of neuronal polarization in culture conditions and in vivo. We also survey the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal polarization. Finally, we introduce the theoretical basis of neuronal polarization and the possible involvement of neuronal polarity in disease and traumatic brain injury.},

Recently, a second factor, Wnt, with similar activity was found. However, the relationship between these completely different signals mediating the overlapping functions is still unclear. Here, we report that the conditioned medium of L cells expressing Wnt3a maintains ES cells in the undifferentiated state in feeder-free culture, followed by expression of stem cell markers and their ability to generate germline chimaeras. However, although the activity of this conditioned medium is dependent on Wnt3a, recombinant Wnt3a protein cannot maintain ES cells in the undifferentiated state. As supplementation with Wnt3a to the sub-threshold level of LIF alone was not sufficient to maintain ES self-renewal, the results of maintenance of the undifferentiated state indicated the synergistic action of Wnt and LIF. Induction of constitutively activated beta-catenin alone is unable to maintain ES self-renewal but shows a synergistic effect with LIF. These observations indicate that the Wnt signal mediated by the canonical pathway is not sufficient but enhances the effect of LIF to maintain self-renewal of mouse ES cells.},

We furthermore show that introduction of N-WASP mutants lacking the ability to bind Abp1 or Cdc42, Arp2/3 complex inhibition, Abp1 knock down, N-WASP knock down and Arp3 knock down, all cause identical neuromorphological phenotypes.

In particular, medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells contains a polypeptide factor, ES cell differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA), which specifically suppresses the spontaneous differentiation of ES cells in vitro, thereby permitting their growth as homogeneous stem cell populations in the absence of heterologous feeder cells. ES cell pluripotentiality, including the ability to give rise to functional gametes, is preserved after prolonged culture in Buffalo rat liver media as a source of DIA. Here, we report that purified DIA is related in structure and function to the recently identified hematopoietic regulatory factors human interleukin for DA cells and leukaemia inhibitory factor.

  abstract      = {Self-renewal of rodent embryonic stem cells is enhanced by partial inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3; refs 1, 2). This effect has variously been attributed to stimulation of Wnt signalling by beta-catenin, stabilization of Myc protein and global de-inhibition of anabolic processes. Here we demonstrate that beta-catenin is not necessary for embryonic stem cell identity or expansion, but its absence eliminates the self-renewal response to Gsk3 inhibition. Responsiveness is fully restored by truncated beta-catenin lacking the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain. However, requirement for Gsk3 inhibition is dictated by expression of T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) and mediated by direct interaction with beta-catenin. Tcf3 localizes to many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells. Our findings confirm that Tcf3 acts as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that beta-catenin directly abrogates Tcf3 function. We conclude that Gsk3 inhibition stabilizes the embryonic stem cell state primarily by reducing repressive influence on the core pluripotency network.},

  abstract      = {Direct differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into functional motor neurons represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, to screen new drug compounds, and to develop new therapies for motor neuron diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Many current protocols use a combination of retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog (Shh) to differentiate mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells into motor neurons(1-4). However, the differentiation efficiency of mES cells into motor neurons has only met with moderate success. We have developed a two-step differentiation protocol(5) that significantly improves the differentiation efficiency compared with currently established protocols. The first step is to enhance the neuralization process by adding Noggin and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Noggin is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and is implicated in neural induction according to the default model of neurogenesis and results in the formation of anterior neural patterning(6). FGF signaling acts synergistically with Noggin in inducing neural tissue formation by promoting a posterior neural identity(7-9). In this step, mES cells were primed with Noggin, bFGF, and FGF-8 for two days to promote differentiation towards neural lineages. The second step is to induce motor neuron specification. Noggin/FGFs exposed mES cells were incubated with RA and a Shh agonist, Smoothened agonist (SAG), for another 5 days to facilitate motor neuron generation. To monitor the differentiation of mESs into motor neurons, we used an ES cell line derived from a transgenic mouse expressing eGFP under the control of the motor neuron specific promoter Hb9(1). Using this robust protocol, we achieved 51±0.8\% of differentiation efficiency (n = 3; p < 0.01, Student's t-test)(5). Results from immunofluorescent staining showed that GFP+ cells express the motor neuron specific markers, Islet-1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Our two-step differentiation protocol provides an efficient way to differentiate mES cells into spinal motor neurons.},

  abstract      = {Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon whereby monoallelic gene expression occurs in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. A subset of imprinted genes acquires a tissue-specific imprinted status during the course of tissue development, and this process can be analyzed by means of an in vitro differentiation system utilizing embryonic stem (ES) cells. In neurons, the gene Ube3a is expressed from the maternal allele only, and a paternally expressed non-coding, antisense RNA has been implicated in the imprinting process in mice and humans. Here, to study the genomic imprinting mechanism, we established F1 hybrid ES cells derived from two sub-species of Mus musculus and established an in vitro neuronal differentiation system in which neuron-specific imprinting of Ube3a was recapitulated. With this system, we revealed that the switch from biallelic expression to maternal, monoallelic expression of Ube3a occurs late in neuronal development, during the neurite outgrowth period, and that the expression of endogenous antisense transcript from the Ube3a locus is up-regulated several hundred-fold during the same period. Our results suggest that evaluation of the quality of ES cells by studying their differentiation in vitro should include evaluation of epigenetic aspects, such as a comparison with the genomic imprinting status found in tissues in vivo, in addition to the evaluation of differentiation gene markers and morphology. Our F1 hybrid ES cells and in vitro differentiation system will allow researchers to investigate complex end-points such as neuron-specific genomic imprinting, and our F1 hybrid ES cells are a useful resource for other tissue-specific genomic imprinting and epigenetic analyses.},

  abstract      = {High-throughput screening is an essential process in drug discovery. The ability to identify true active compounds depends on the high quality of assays and proper analysis of data. The Z factor, presented by Zhang et al. in 1999, provides an easy and useful summary of assay quality and has been a widely accepted standard. However, as data analysis has undergone much improvement recently, the assessment of assay quality has not evolved in parallel. In this article, the authors study the implications of Z factor values under different conditions and link the Z factor with the power of discovering true active compounds. They discuss the different interpretations of Z factor depending on error distributions and advocate direct analysis of power as assay quality assessment. They also propose that in estimating assay quality parameters, adjustments in data analysis should be taken into account. Studying the power of identifying true “hits” gives a more direct interpretation of assay quality and may provide guidance in assay optimization on some occasions.},

The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the "suitability" of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called "Z- factor," is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.},

  abstract  = {Roughly 20\% of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are syndromic with a  well-established genetic cause. Studying the genes involved can provide insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ASD. 2q23.1 deletion syndrome (causative gene, MBD5) is a recently identified genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with ASD. Mutations in MBD5 have been found in ASD cohorts. In this study, we provide a phenotypic update on the prevalent features of 2q23.1 deletion syndrome, which include severe intellectual disability, seizures, significant speech impairment, sleep disturbance, and autistic-like behavioral problems. Next, we examined the phenotypic, molecular, and network/pathway relationships between nine neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ASD: 2q23.1 deletion Rett, Angelman, Pitt-Hopkins, 2q23.1 duplication, 5q14.3 deletion, Kleefstra, Kabuki make-up, and Smith-Magenis syndromes. We show phenotypic overlaps consisting of intellectual disability, speech delay, seizures, sleep disturbance, hypotonia, and autistic-like behaviors. Molecularly, MBD5 possibly regulates the expression of UBE3A, TCF4, MEF2C, EHMT1 and RAI1. Network analysis reveals that there could be indirect protein interactions, further implicating function for these genes in common pathways. Further, we show that when MBD5 and RAI1 are haploinsufficient, they perturb several common pathways that are linked to neuronal and behavioral development. These findings support further investigations into the molecular and pathway relationships among genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and ASD, which will hopefully lead to common points of regulation that may be targeted toward therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract  = {Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the leading genetic cause of obesity. After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a ∼4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS. To test this hypothesis, we created a ∼150 kb deletion of the >40 copies of Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) in C57BL/6 mice. Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation.},

  abstract  = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitin protein E3A ligase gene (UBE3A) gene is imprinted with maternal-specific expression in neurons and biallelically expressed in all other cell types. Both loss of function and gain of function mutations affecting the expression levels of UBE3A are associated with several neurodevelopmental syndromes and psychological conditions, suggesting that UBE3A is dosage sensitive in the brain and that imprinting of UBE3A might have evolved as a dosage regulating mechanism. Why UBE3A is specifically imprinted in neurons and not in other cell types, however, is unknown. To determine whether imprinting of UBE3A functions as a dosage regulating mechanism, we examined UBE3A transcript and protein levels among cells, tisseus, and species with different imprinting states of UBE3A. We found no correlation between the imprinting status and expression levels of UBE3A. Importantly, we found that in mouse, expression of the maternal Ube3a allele is upregulated during neurogenesis, fully compensating for the loss of expression of paternal Ube3a allele. Based on these findings, we propose that imprinting of Ube3a/UBE3A does not function to reduce the dosage of Ube3a/UBE3A in neurons, but rather to regulate some other, yet to be determined, aspect of gene expression or protein function.},
