\indent I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Burgess, Dr. Segal, and Dr. Threadgill, for their insight and guidance throughout the course of my doctoral research training. A special thank you goes to Dr. Jane Welsh for her support, constant encouragement and motivation, all of which are immeasurable.

I must also thank my program faculty and staff for their assistance.  will miss the familiarity of seeing Ms. Julia in her office. Additionally, I want to give a thanks to the Department of Biochemistry and the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology staff for always greeting me with a welcoming smile. Finally, the Texas A\&M University Interdisciplinary Genetics Program and the Texas A\&M University College of Veterinary Medicine \& Biomedical Sciences, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology were instrumental in supporting my research pursuits.

I would like to recognize:
Mrs. Shrock my first grade teacher who managed to inscribe a love of reading, which managed to survive despite racist teachers actively working to tear me down a few years later.
Ms. Jocelyn Sisson my tenth grade English teacher who gave me a backbone and didn't let me settle for anything less than perfection.
Dr. Bilal M. M. Bomani for teaching me the importance of networking and interpersonal relationships.
Dr. Danny Alge for teaching me the scientific method.
And Dr. James Cooper for teaching me how to design and execute experiments.

Thank you to Dr. William Griffith, Annette Fincher, who took time out of their busy schedules to teach me electrophysology despite it not making it into this body of work.
I also want to thank Dr. Rola Mouneimne, Dr. Clifford Stephan, Ms. Mary Sovieski, and Ms. Ivy Nuygen who all provided valuable technical support and education that allowed the completion of intricate aspects of this study.

An immense thanks go to my fellow graduate students, colleagues and lab members: Dr. Sarah Black Christian, Dr. Cole McQueen, Dr. Paul R Hillman, and Ms. Hillary Shaheen. Thank you all for your assistance.
A special thank you goes to the Genetics Graduate Student Society for being an open place to talk with many late nights, free food, and much needed laughter. I wouldn't have been able to get through this without the camaraderie.

Finally, I cannot thank my family enough for their love and support.
To my supportive family, willing to listen to me talk about my research, especially my Aunt Velma who must have heard me explain my research more than a dozen times.
My little brother Victor and little sister Izzy, who understand the numerous holidays and birthdays I had to miss because of this work.
To older sister Tasha, who's support and understanding was unmeasurable.
My other brother Joshua, who was always in my corner and to this day is still my greatest hero.
To my twin, Erica, for always lending an ear and wanting for fight for me at every turn during this difficult and trying process.
