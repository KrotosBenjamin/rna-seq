  abstract  = {The ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway plays a major role in selective protein degradation. Ubiquitination of proteins requires the sequential action of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and in some cases ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). The oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 utilize this cellular proteolytic system to target the tumor suppressor protein p53. The HPV E6 oncoprotein binds to a cellular protein of 100 kd, termed E6-associated protein (E6-AP). The E6-E6-AP complex specifically interacts with p53, resulting in the rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. Here we report the purification and identification of the factors necessary for the E6-E6-AP-mediated ubiquitination of p53. The ubiquitination of p53 requires the E1 enzyme and a novel E2 in mammalian cells, while E3 activity is conferred by the E6-E6-AP complex. Furthermore, E6-AP appears to have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in the absence of E6.},

  abstract  = {Currently, there is a limited understanding of the factors that influence the localization and density of individual synapses in the central nervous system. Here we have studied the effects of activity on synapse formation between hippocampal dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons in culture, taking advantage of FM1-43 as a fluorescent marker of synaptic boutons. We observed an early tendency for synapses to group together, quickly followed by the appearance of synaptic clusters on dendritic processes. These events were strongly influenced by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor- and cyclic AMP-dependent signaling. The microstructure and localization of the synaptic clusters resembled that found in hippocampus, at mossy fiber synapses of stratum lucidum. Activity-dependent clustering of synapses represents a means for synaptic targeting that might contribute to synaptic organization in the brain.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is a system of non-Mendelian inheritance that is unique to mammals. Two types of imprinted genes show parent-of-origin-specific expression patterns: the paternally expressed genes (Pegs), and the maternally expressed genes (Megs). Parental genomic imprinting memory is maintained in the somatic cell lineage and regulates the expression of Pegs and Megs, while it is erased and re-established in the germ cell lineage according to the sex of the individual. The paternal and maternal imprinting mechanisms, which regulate different sets of Pegs and Megs, are essential for establishing the parental expression profiles of imprinted genes that are observed in sperms and eggs. Based on recent evidence, we outline the relationship between parental imprinting and the expression profiles of Pegs and Megs and discuss a novel view of the regulation of genomic imprinting. We also discuss the biological significance of genomic imprinting and propose hypotheses on the essential nature of genomic imprinting and the close relationship between genomic imprinting and the acquisition of placental tissues during mammalian evolution.}

  abstract  = {Gene expression from both parental alleles (biallelic expression) is beneficial in minimizing the occurrence of recessive genetic disorders in diploid organisms. However, imprinted genes in mammals display parent of origin-specific monoallelic expression. As some imprinted genes play essential roles in mammalian development, the reason why mammals adopted the genomic imprinting mechanism has been a mystery since its discovery. In this review, based on the recent studies on imprinted gene regulation we discuss several advantageous features of a monoallelic expression mechanism and the necessity of genomic imprinting in the current mammalian developmental system. We further speculate how the present genomic imprinting system has been established during mammalian evolution by the mechanism of complementation between paternal and maternal genomes under evolutionary pressure predicted by the genetic conflict hypothesis.},
