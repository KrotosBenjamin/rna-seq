\chapter{\uppercase {\textit{UBE3A} imprinting in neurons: a unique model for antisense lncRNA regulation}}

The genomic instability of chromosome 15q11-q13 results in multiple disorders, two of which seems to be linked to ubiquitin ligase E3A protein (UBE3A) expression, also known as E6AP, \cite{Christian1999,Kishino1997,Matsuura1997,Nurmi2001}. The non-Mendelian inheritance of these disorders are a result of genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon that results in the differential expression of diploid alleles in a parent-of-origin specific manner \cite{Russo1996}. With respect to \textit{UBE3A}, it is clear that expression and dosage levels are important for human brain development and functionality. As such, the unique imprinting of \textit{UBE3A} in only neurons is perplexing. Although it is possible that the imprint could be an innocent bystander, the fact that it has been evolutionarily constrained for over 100 million years suggests otherwise \cite{Rapkins2006}. The focus of this review is to examine the functional significance of the imprinting mechanism of \textit{UBE3A} and the roles antisense long non-coding RNA play in regulation of the sense transcripts.

\section{Diseases of Chromosome 15q11-q13}
The long arm of human chromosome 15 is characterized by the relatively frequent chromosome rearrangements, which are due to low-copy repeat elements at two proximal and one distal region of 15q11-q13 region \cite{Amos-Landgraf1999,Ji2000,Ji1999,Pujana2001}. \textbf{Figure 1-1} depicts the breakpoint locations around the \textit{HERC2} (HECT, homologous to the E6AP carboxyl terminus, and RDL, regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) like domain, domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2) duplicons and the percentage of usages within the large-scale deletions. This instability results in multiple structural abnormalities, including deletions, duplications, and translocations \cite{Buiting1998,Christian1999,Jiang2008,Pujana2002,Webb1994} resulting in three distinct neurodevelopmental disorders: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Chromosome 15q11-q13 Duplication syndrome (Dup15q) and Angelman syndrome (AS).

\subsection{Prader-Willi Syndrome}
Prader-Willi syndrome (OMIM \#176270) is characterized by neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive, hyperphagia in early childhood leading to obesity, hypogonadism, short stature, behavior problems, and mild to moderate intellectual disability \cite{Cassidy2012,Goldstone2004}. The genetic or epigenetic mutations causing PWS are associated with the specific loss of paternal expression of the box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) generated from \textit{SNORD116} cluster (previously referred as \textit{HBII-85}) in the brain \cite{Bortolin-Cavaille2012,Ding2008,Duker2010}. The spectrum of mutations causing PWS include: (i) paternal interstitial deletions of 15q11-q13 region, (ii) maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15, (iii) genomic imprinting defects of the region, or (iv) loss-of-function mutations in \textit{SNORD116} gene cluster \cite{Cassidy2012}.

\subsection{Chromosome 15q11-q13 Duplication Syndrome}
Chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (OMIM \#608636) is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, early central hypotonia, seizures, and social impairment \cite{Battaglia2008}. Additionally, duplication of 15q11-q13 is one of the most common genetic mutations observed in individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder \cite{Battaglia2008,Bolton2001,Cook1997,Nurmi2001,Schroer1998}. Chromosome 15q duplication syndrome is primarily caused by maternal duplications of chromosome 15q11-q13 \cite{Battaglia2008,Browne1997}. Currently, Dup15q is known to occur via one of two ways: interstitial duplication of 15q, or extra isodicentric chromosome of 15q \cite{Battaglia2008,Klei2012}. As the neurodevelopmental disorder is caused by maternal inheritance of duplications, it is linked to the overexpression of ubiquitin ligase E3A protein (UBE3A) \cite{Nurmi2001}.

\subsection{Angelman Syndrome}

Angelman syndrome (OMIM \#105830) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent speech, ataxia, seizures, frequent smiling and inappropriate laughter \cite{Williams2006}. Although clinically distinct, AS shares a common pathogenesis with Dup15q, namely dysregulation of UBE3A protein. In contrast to Dup15q, the genetic or epigenetic mutations causing AS are associated with the specific loss of maternal expression of UBE3A protein in the brain \cite{Kishino1997,Matsuura1997,Williams2006}. The spectrum of mutations causing AS include: (i) maternal interstitial deletions of 15q11-q13 region, (ii) paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15, (iii) genomic imprinting defects of 15q11-q13, or (iv) loss-of-function mutations in the \textit{UBE3A} gene \cite{Williams2006}.

\section{Ubiquitin Ligase E3A Protein Gene}

The \textit{UBE3A} gene is located within the 15q11-q13 imprinted domain and encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is a central component of the ubiquitin proteasome system involving the successive action of E1 (ubiquitin-activating), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating), and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases activities \cite{Huibregtse1995,Scheffner1995}. The UBE3A protein is a unique ligase as it can catalyze the formation of isopeptides via its HECT domain without the help of E2 proteins. In addition, UBE3A has been shown to function as a typical ubiquitin ligase and a transcriptional coactivator of steroid hormone receptors \cite{Kumar1999,Sun2012}. Thus far, numerous cellular proteins have been shown to interact directly or indirectly with UBE3A suggesting that is has diverse cellular functions (\textbf{Appendix I}).

\subsection{\emph{UBE3A} in Neurons}

The non-Mendelian inheritance pattern of AS is due to genomic imprinting of \textit{UBE3A} \cite{Kishino1997,Matsuura1997}; however, \textit{UBE3A}, unlike most imprinted genes, is expressed from both parental alleles in almost all cell types except for neurons \cite{Landers2004,Rougeulle1998,Runte2004,Yamasaki2003}. Expression of the paternal \textit{UBE3A} allele in neurons is inhibited by the antisense expression of a long polycistronic transcription unit that is comprised of \textit{SNURF/SNRPN}, clusters of C/D box snoRNAs (\textit{SNORD116} and \textit{SNORD115}), and \textit{UBE3A} antisense transcript (\textit{UBE3A-AS}) \cite{Landers2004,Meng2012,Meng2013,Runte2001,Runte2004}. \textbf{Figure 1-2} shows the polycistronic transcription unit transcribed from the paternal allele (blue) with the overlapping antisense transcript silencing \textit{UBE3A} (black).

There some unknown mechanism \textit{UBE3A-AS} inhibits expression of paternal \textit{UBE3A}. Paternally expressed genes in blue and paternally silenced \textit{UBE3A} in black.}

\section{Genomic Imprinting}

Mammals are diploid organisms that inherit a chromosome set from each parent. As a result, the majority of genes are expressed from both parents; however, a subset of genes show parent-specific gene expression due to epigenetic modifications. \textbf{Figure 1-3} depicts normal biallelic expression compared to the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. There are over a 100 of these imprinted genes in mouse and humans \cite{Radford2011,Santoro2011}; the majority of which are found within gene clusters that house at least one non-coding RNA and several protein coding genes.

\subsection{Imprinting Control Regions}

Epigenetics is defined as heritable modifications of the genome that are not genetic changes (e.g. DNA and chromatin modifications) \cite{Bird2007}. As imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon, the imprinted genes must be able to acquire modifications, maintain imprinting status, and be re-established in the germline. For imprinted gene clusters, large-range \textit{cis}-acting imprinting control regions (ICRs) are responsible for acquiring parental modification and maintaining imprinting status \cite{Edwards2007,Edwards2007a,Spahn2003}. All ICRs have differential DNA methylation regions (DMR), which carry parental information \cite{Ciccone2009}.

The ICR for PWS and AS has a bipartite structure comprising the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome imprinting centers (PWS-IC and AS-IC); thus, giving this ICR bidirectional control of the cluster of imprinted genes in the 15q11-q13 region \cite{Nicholls1996}. The PWS-IC is a positive regulatory element responsible for the establishment and maintenance of paternal gene expression \cite{Nicholls2001}, while AS-IC negatively regulate PWS-IC on the maternal chromosome \cite{Brannan1999}.

Differential methylation is associated with a CpG island surrounding the promoter and exon 1 of \textit{SNRPN} \cite{Blaydes1999}. In somatic cells of human and mouse, PWS-IC is heavily CpG methylated on the maternal chromosome, and is almost completely unmethylated on the paternal chromosome \cite{Glenn1996,Shemer1997}. The AS-IC on the maternal allele confers DNA methylation and suppression of PWS-IC, but is methylated and inactive on the paternal allele. This results in PWS-IC regulates the majority of the genes as paternal expression expect for \textit{UBE3A} and \textit{ATP10A}, which are maternally expressed \cite{Brannan1999, Kantor2006}.

\section{Function of Imprinting}

No matter the theory, the overall result of imprinting is the differential silencing of alleles. This imprinting does not happen by chance as it is often evolutionary conserved between mouse and humans. For example, the imprinted cluster within 15q11-q13 arose 105-180 million years ago \cite{Rapkins2006}; and despite the disease phenotypes and genomic instability associated with the region, it remains. For some reason, it is advantageous to imprint this gene cluster and many others. One way to explore what makes the imprinting of gene clusters advantageous is to investigate the function of the imprinted genes. Are the genes dosage sensitive? Does the imprint increase regulatory function? For the 15q11-q13 imprinting cluster, these answers are not readily apparent.

\subsection{Dosage Regulation}

Why \textit{Ube3a} became imprinted in neurons is unclear. The current theory is that \textit{Ube3a-AS} evolved to reduce \textit{Ube3a} expression in neurons to regulate dosage because termination of \textit{Ube3a-AS} leads to increased levels of Ube3a expression in the brain \cite{Huang2012,King2013,Meng2013}. When our laboratory rigorously tested this theory, we determined that the function of the imprinting mechanism was not to reduce the expression of Ube3a in the brain, as there was no correlation between the imprint and expression levels of \textit{Ube3a/UBE3A} in mouse and human \emph{(Hillman et al., in preparation)}. Additionally, while the paternal \emph{Ube3a} allele was silenced the maternal allele was upregulated during development so that overall Ube3a expression remained unchanged \emph{(Hillman et al., in preparation)}. Altogether, the findings suggest that imprinting of Ube3a in neurons may have evolved for reasons other than to reduce Ube3a expression in neurons.

\subsection{Regulatory Function}

The evolution of \textit{SNRPN} is a good example of a duplication event leading to tissue-specific imprinting with alternative function from its ancestor gene, \textit{SNRPB/B’}. Studies have shown that \textit{Snrpn} originated from \textit{Snrpb}, a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) gene encoding for SmB in mice, locus via a duplication event about 180-210 million years ago \cite{Gray1999,Rapkins2006}. While SmB is replaced by SmN in the brain, \textit{SNRPB/B’} is upregulate in the absence of \textit{SNRPN} suggesting that the two genes are tightly regulated \cite{Gray1999,Nahkuri2008}. Despite their similarities, \textit{SNRPB/B’} and \textit{SNRPN} have distinct snRNP association along with tissue-specific expression, suggesting that \textit{SNRPN} has evolved an alternative function compared to its ancestral gene \cite{Huntriss1993}.

Given the current findings, \textit{Ube3a} does not appear to be imprint as a mechanism to regulate dosage in neurons. With that in mind it is possible that \textit{Ube3a} is imprinted in neurons because of additional regulatory functions. While \textit{Ube3a} is highly expressed in the brain, the imprint has no effect on overall expression \emph{(Hillman et al., in preparation)}. Therefore, it is unlikely that the imprint of \textit{Ube3a} is directly linked to Ube3a protein expression; however, its long non-coding antisense RNA transcript, \textit{Ube3a-AS}, arises only in neurons as part of the imprinting mechanism of \textit{Ube3a}. Further study of this transcript may reveal the functional reason for imprinting Ube3a in neurons.

\section{Long Non-Coding RNA}

Over the last few decades, the scientific community has increasingly become fascinated with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), and with good reason. With the advancement of genomic sequencing technologies, numerous annotations and deep sequencing from multiple species have demonstrated that ncRNAs are more abundant than protein-coding genes \cite{Clark2011,Kapranov2007a}. To put this in perspective, of the 75-90\% of the human genome that is transcribed, only 3\% is protein-coding \cite{Carninci2005,Consortium2012,Djebali2012,Guttman2009,Kapranov2007}. More importantly, this is not transcriptional noise as these ncRNAs perform a myriad of functions by interacting with DNA, RNA, and proteins similar to protein-coding genes \cite{Mattick2005,Mercer2009}. The importance of ncRNAs extends to genomic imprinting as well since all ICRs have at least one lncRNA expressed from the unmethylated parental chromosome \cite{Lee2013,Mohammad2009,Sleutels2002}. Even with the clear importance of ncRNA, the function of the majority of ncRNAs, especially lncRNAs, is unknown.

Recently, the importance of ncRNAs in tissue- and developmental stage-specific gene expression has been extensively explored. Moreover, increasing evidence implements them in brain development, synaptic plasticity, and neurological disease, with the highest proportion of tissue-specific lncRNA expression in the brain \cite{Derrien2012,Washietl2014}. Long non-coding RNAs are less understood. With no common sequence or structure, classification is difficult. In general, lncRNA preform many similar roles as ncRNAs, like microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, and are separate from ncRNAs via size (>200 bp). A simplistic classification of lncRNAs uses loci-of-origin resulting in several different categories, three of which, enhancer RNAs, overlapping RNAs, and intergenic RNAs, are depicted in \textbf{Figure 1-4}. These three types of lncRNA are all present within ICRs \cite{Bartolomei1991,Darrow2013,Katayama2005,Wevrick1997,Wevrick1994}, with some of the most well-studied lncRNAs in ICRs being antisense lncRNA.
