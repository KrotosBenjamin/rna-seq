  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon whereby monoallelic gene expression occurs in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. A subset of imprinted genes acquires a tissue-specific imprinted status during the course of tissue development, and this process can be analyzed by means of an in vitro differentiation system utilizing embryonic stem (ES) cells. In neurons, the gene Ube3a is expressed from the maternal allele only, and a paternally expressed non-coding, antisense RNA has been implicated in the imprinting process in mice and humans. Here, to study the genomic imprinting mechanism, we established F1 hybrid ES cells derived from two sub-species of Mus musculus and established an in vitro neuronal differentiation system in which neuron-specific imprinting of Ube3a was recapitulated. With this system, we revealed that the switch from biallelic expression to maternal, monoallelic expression of Ube3a occurs late in neuronal development, during the neurite outgrowth period, and that the expression of endogenous antisense transcript from the Ube3a locus is up-regulated several hundred-fold during the same period. Our results suggest that evaluation of the quality of ES cells by studying their differentiation in vitro should include evaluation of epigenetic aspects, such as a comparison with the genomic imprinting status found in tissues in vivo, in addition to the evaluation of differentiation gene markers and morphology. Our F1 hybrid ES cells and in vitro differentiation system will allow researchers to investigate complex end-points such as neuron-specific genomic imprinting, and our F1 hybrid ES cells are a useful resource for other tissue-specific genomic imprinting and epigenetic analyses.},

  abstract ={High-throughput screening is an essential process in drug discovery. The ability to identify true active compounds depends on the high quality of assays and proper analysis of data. The Z factor, presented by Zhang et al. in 1999, provides an easy and useful summary of assay quality and has been a widely accepted standard. However, as data analysis has undergone much improvement recently, the assessment of assay quality has not evolved in parallel. In this article, the authors study the implications of Z factor values under different conditions and link the Z factor with the power of discovering true active compounds. They discuss the different interpretations of Z factor depending on error distributions and advocate direct analysis of power as assay quality assessment. They also propose that in estimating assay quality parameters, adjustments in data analysis should be taken into account. Studying the power of identifying true “hits” gives a more direct interpretation of assay quality and may provide guidance in assay optimization on some occasions.},

Solubility decreased overall as the mice aged; Purkinje cells, the most affected in SCA1, did not form aggregates of mutant protein until an advanced stage of disease.

  abstract ={The ability to identify active compounds ("hits") from large chemical libraries accurately and rapidly has been the ultimate goal in developing high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the "suitability" of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called "Z- factor," is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.},

  abstract ={Hit selection is the ultimate goal in many high-throughput screens. Various analytic methods are available for this purpose. Some commonly used ones are z score, z* score, strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD), SSMD*, and t statistic. It is critical to know how to use them correctly because the misusage of them can readily produce misleading results. Here, the author presents basic concepts, elaborates their commonality and difference, describes some common misusage that people should avoid, and uses simulated simple examples to illustrate how to use them correctly.},
